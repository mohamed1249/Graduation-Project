Proposals for Revisions .    Proposals for the revision of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria were develo ped by members of the.    work groups on the basis of ra tionale, scope of change, expected impact on clinical man-.    agement and public health, strength of the su pporting research evidence, overall clarity,.    and clinical utility. Proposals encompassed chan ges to diagnostic criteria; the addition of.    new disorders, subtypes, an d specifiers; and the deleti on of existing disorders. .    In the proposals for revisions, strengths and weaknesses in the current criteria and no-.    sology were first identified. Novel scientific findings over the previous two decades were.    considered, leading to the creation of a resear ch plan to assess potential changes through.    literature reviews and se condary data analyses. Four princi ples guided the draft revisions:.    1) DSM-5 is primarily intended to be a manual to be used by clinicians, and revisions must.    be feasible for routine clinical practice; 2)  recommendations for revisions should be guided.    by research evidence; 3) where possible, co ntinuity should be maintained with previous.    editions of DSM; and 4) no a priori constraints should be placed on the degree of change.    between DSM-IV and DSM-5. .    Building on the initial lite rature reviews, work groups identified key issues within.    their diagnostic areas. Work  groups also examined broa der methodological concerns,.    such as the presence of contra dictory findings within the literature; development of a re-.    fined definition of mental disorder; cross-cutting issues relevant to all disorders; and the.    revision of disorders categorized in DSM-IV as “not otherwise specified.” Inclusion of a.    proposal for revision in Section II was informed by consideration of its advantages and.    disadvantages for public health and clinical ut ility, the strength of the evidence, and the.    magnitude of the change.

The same cultur al term often serves more than one of these functions. .    Gender Differences.    Sex and gender differences as they relate to th e causes and expression of medical conditions.    are established for a number of diseases, including selected mental disorders. Revisions to.    DSM-5 included review of potential differenc es between men and women in the expression.    of mental illness. In terms of nomenclature, sex differences  are variations attributable to an.    individual’s reproductive organs an d XX or XY chromosomal complement. Gender differ-.    ences are variations that result from biological sex as well as an individual’s self-represen-.    tation that includes the psychological, be havioral, and social consequences of one’s.    perceived gender. The term gender differences  is used in DSM-5 because, more commonly,.    the differences between men and women are a re sult of both biological sex and individual.    self-representation. However, some of the di fferences are based on only biological sex. .    Gender can influence illness in a variety of ways. First, it may exclusively determine.    whether an individual is at risk for a disord er (e.g., as in premenstrual dysphoric disor-.    der). Second, gender may moderate the overa ll risk for development of a disorder as.    shown by marked gender differences in the prevalence and incidence rates for selected.    mental disorders. Third, gender may influence the likelihood that particular symptoms of.    a disorder are experienced by an individual . Attention-deficit/hype ractivity disorder is.    an example of a disorder with differences in  presentation that are most commonly expe-.    rienced by boys or girls. Gender likely has other effects on the experience of a disorder that.    are indirectly relevant to psychiatric diagnosis. It may be that certain symptoms are more.    readily endorsed by men or women, and that this contributes to differences in service pro-.    vision (e.g., women may be more likely to recognize a depr essive, bipolar, or anxiety dis-.    order and endorse a more comprehen sive list of symptoms than men). .    Reproductive life cycle events, including estr ogen variations, also contribute to gender.    differences in risk and expression of illness. Thus, a specifier for postpartum onset of mania.    or major depressive episode denotes a time frame wherein women may be at increased risk.    for the onset of an illness episode. In the case  of sleep and energy, alterations are often nor-.    mative postpartum and thus may have lower diagnostic reliability in postpartum women. .    The manual is configured to include information on gender at  multiple levels. If there.    are gender-specific symptoms, th ey have been added to the di agnostic criteria. A gender-.    related specifier, such as perinatal onset of a mood episode, provides additional informa-.    tion on gender and diagnosis. Finally, other issues that are pertinent to diagnosis and gen-.    der considerations can be found in the se ction “Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues.”.    Use of Other Specified and Unspecified Disorders.    To enhance diagnostic specificity, DSM-5 repl aces the previous NOS designation with two.    options for clinical use: other specified disorder  and unspecified disorder.  The other specified.    disorder category is provided to allow the clinician to communicate the specific reason.    that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific category within a diagnos-.    tic class. This is done by recording the name of the category, followed by the specific rea-.    son. For example, for an in dividual with clin ically significant depressive symptoms.    lasting 4 weeks but whose symptomatology falls short of the diagnostic threshold for a.    major depressive episode, the clinician would re cord “other specified depressive disorder,.    depressive episode with insufficient symptoms.” If the clinician chooses not to specify the"}]}

Since children of the same chronological age may be at different.    developmental stages, it is difficult to defi ne with precision what is “normal” or “ex-.    pected” at any given point.

Bipolar II disorder is characterized by a clin ical course of recurr ing mood episodes con-.    sisting of one or more majo r depressive episodes (Criteria A–C under “Major Depressive.    Episode”) and at least one hypomanic epis ode (Criteria A–F under “Hypomanic Epi-.    sode”). The major depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks, and the hypomanic epi-.    sode must last at least 4 days, to meet the di agnostic criteria. During the mood episode(s),.    the requisite number of symptoms  must be present most of th e day, nearly every day, and.    represent a noticeable change from usual behavior and functioning. The presence of a.    manic episode during the course of illness pr ecludes the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder.    (Criterion B under “Bipolar II Disorder”). Episodes of substance/medication-induced de-.    pressive disorder or substance/medication-i nduced bipolar and related disorder (repre-.    senting the physiological effects of a medicati on, other somatic treatments for depression,.    drugs of abuse, or toxin exposure) or of de pressive and related disorder due to another.    medical condition or bipolar and related disord er due to another medi cal condition do not.    count toward a diagnosis of bi polar II disorder unless they persist beyond the physiolog-.    ical effects of the treatment or substance and then meet duration criteria for an episode. In.    addition, the episodes must not be better acco unted for by schizoaffective disorder and are.    not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or.    other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders (Cri-.    terion C under “Bipolar II Disorder”).

Although bipolar II disorder can begin in late adolescence and throughout adulthood, av-.    erage age at onset is the mid-20s, which is slight ly later than for bipolar I disorder but ear-.    lier than for major depressive  disorder. The illness most of ten begins with a depressive.    episode and is not recognized as bipolar II d isorder until a hypomanic episode occurs; this.    happens in about 12% of individuals with the initial diagnosis of major depressive disor-.    der. Anxiety, substance use, or eating diso rders may also precede the diagnosis, compli-.    cating its detection. Many individuals expe rience several episodes of major depression.    prior to the first recognized hypomanic episode. .    The number of lifetime episodes (both hypomanic and major depressive episodes).    tends to be higher for bipolar II disorder than for major depressive disorder or bipolar I.    disorder. However, individuals with bipolar I disorder are actually more likely to experi-.    ence hypomanic symptoms than  are individuals with bipolar II disorder.The interval.    between mood episodes in the co urse of bipolar II disorder tends to decrease as the indi-.    vidual ages. While the hypomanic episode is the feature that defines bipolar II disorder,.    depressive episodes are more enduring and disabling over time. Despite the predomi-.    nance of depression, once a hypomanic epis ode has occurred, the diagnosis becomes bi-.    polar II disorder and never reve rts to major depressive disorder"}]}

Bipolar disorders. The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disor-.    der and bipolar disorders in children involves the longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In.    children, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipo lar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness.    with discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child’s typical.    presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs  during a manic episode is distinctly different.    from the child’s usual mood. In addition, during a manic episode, the change in mood must be.    accompanied by the onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical.    symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-dir ected activity), which are also present to a de-.    gree that is distinctly different from the child’s  usual baseline. Thus, in the case of a manic ep-.    isode, parents (and, depending on  developmental level, children) should be able to identify a.    distinct time period during which the child’s  mood and behavior were markedly different.    from usual. In contrast, the irritability of disr uptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent.    and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irri-.    tability is characteristic of the child with disr uptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, while.    bipolar disorders are episodic conditions, disrup tive mood dysregulation disorder is not. In.    fact, the diagnosis of di sruptive mood dysregulation disorder  cannot be assi gned to a child.    who has ever experienced a full-duration hypoma nic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric).    or who has ever had a manic or hypomanic epis ode lasting more than 1 day. Another central.    differentiating feature between bipolar disorder s and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.    is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common.    features of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dy sregulation disorder. .    Oppositional defiant disorder. While symptoms of opposition al defiant disorder typi-.    cally do occur in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, mood symptoms.    of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder ar e relatively rare in children with opposi-.    tional defiant disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood.    dysregulation disorder in children whose sympto ms also meet criteria  for oppositional de-.    fiant disorder are the presence of severe an d frequently recurrent outbursts and a persis-.    tent disruption in mood betw een outbursts. In addition, the diagnosis of disruptive mood.    dysregulation disorder requires severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home,.    school, or among peers) and mild  to moderate impairment in a second setting. For this rea-.    son, while most children whose symptoms meet  criteria for disrup tive mood dysregula-.    tion disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria fo r oppositional defiant.    disorder, the reverse is not the case. That is, in only approximately 15% of individuals with.    oppositional defiant disorder would criteria  for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.    be met. Moreover, even for child ren in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the.    diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Finally, both the.    prominent mood symptoms in disruptive mood  dysregulation disorder and the high risk.    for depressive and anxiety disorders in follow -up studies justify placement of disruptive.    mood dysregulation disorder among the depr essive disorders in DSM-5. (Oppositional.    defiant disorder is included in the chapter “Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct.    Disorders.”) This reflects the more prominent mood comp onent among individuals with.    disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional.    defiant disorder. Nevertheless, it  also should be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation.    disorder appears to carry a high risk for be havioral pr oblems as well as mood problems"}]}

In addition, children  with autism spectrum diso rders frequently present with.    temper outbursts when, for example, their rout ines are disturbed. In that instance, the.    temper outbursts would be considered secondary to the au tism spectrum disorder, and.    the child should not receive the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. .    Intermittent explosive disorder. Children with symptoms su ggestive of intermittent.    explosive disorder present with instances of severe temper outburst s, much like children.    with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. However, unlike disruptive mood dysreg-.    ulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not re quire persistent disruption in.    mood between outbursts. In addition, intermittent explosive disorder requires only 3 months.    of active symptoms, in contrast to the 12- month requirement for disruptive mood dys-.    regulation disorder.

Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysr egulation disorder are extremely high.

DSM-defined syndromes appears higher than for many other pediatric mental illnesses;.    the strongest overlap is with oppositional de fiant disorder.

When separated from major attachment figure s, children with separation anxiety disorder.    may exhibit social withdrawal, apathy, sadne ss, or difficulty concentrating on work or.    play. Depending on their age, individuals may have fears of animals, monsters, the dark,.    muggers, burglars, kidnappers, car accidents, plane travel, and other situations that are.    perceived as presenting danger to the family or themselves. So me individuals become.    homesick and uncomfortable to the point of misery when away from home. Separation.    anxiety disorder in children may lead to school refusal, which in turn may lead to academic.    difficulties and social isolation. When extrem ely upset at the prospect of separation, chil-.    dren may show anger or occasionally aggres sion toward someone who is forcing separa-.    tion. When alone, especially in  the evening or the dark, youn g children may report unusual.    perceptual experiences (e.g., seeing people p eering into their room, frightening creatures.    reaching for them, feeling eyes staring at them ). Children with this disorder may be de-.    scribed as demanding, intrusive, and in need of constant attention, and, as adults, may ap-.    pear dependent and overprotective. The indi vidual’s excessive de mands often become a.    source of frustration fo r family members, leading to resent ment and conflict in the family"}]}

A key feature of this disorder is that the fear or anxiety is circumscribed to the presence of a.    particular situation or object (Criterion A), which may be termed the phobic stimulus"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "  The cat-.    egories of feared situations or objects are provi ded as specifiers. Many individuals fear objects.    or situations from more than one category, or  phobic stimulus. For th e diagnosis of specific.    phobia, the response must differ from normal, transient fears that commonly occur in the pop-.    ulation. To meet the criteria for a diagnosis, the fear or anxiety must be intense or severe (i.e.,.    “marked”) (Criterion A). The amount of fear experienced may vary wi th proximity to the.    feared object or situation and may occur in anticipa tion of or in the actual presence of the object.    or situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of a full or limited symptom panic at-.    tack (i.e., expected panic attack). Another characteri stic of specific phobias is that fear or anxi-.    ety is evoked nearly every time the individual  comes into contact with the phobic stimulus.    (Criterion B). Thus, an indivi dual who becomes anxious only occasionally upon being con-.    fronted with the situation or object (e.g., become s anxious when flying only on one out of every.    five airplane flights) would not be diagnosed with specific phobia. However, the degree of fear.    or anxiety expressed may vary (from anticipatory anxiety to a full panic attack) across different.    occasions of encountering the phobic object or situation because of various contextual factors.    such as the presence of others, duration of exposure, and other threat ening elements such as.    turbulence on a flight for indi viduals who fear flying. Fear and anxiety are often expressed dif-.    ferently between children and adults. Also, the fear  or anxiety occurs as soon as the phobic ob-.    ject or situation is encountered (i.e., immediately rather than being delayed). .    The individual actively avoids the situation, or  if he or she either is unable or decides.    not to avoid it, the situation or object evok es intense fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Active.    avoidance  means the individual intentionally behave s in ways that are designed to prevent.    or minimize contact with phobic objects or situ ations (e.g., takes tunnels instead of bridges.    on daily commute to work for fear of heights; avoids entering a dark room for fear of spi-.    ders; avoids accepting a job in a locale wh ere a phobic stimulus is more common).

Many individuals with specific.    phobias have suffered over many years and have changed their living circumstances in.    ways designed to avoid the phobic object or si tuation as much as possible (e.g., an indi-.    vidual diagnosed with specific phobia, animal , who moves to reside in an area devoid of.    the particular feared animal). Therefore, they no longer experience fear or anxiety in their.    daily life. In such instances, avoidance behavi ors or ongoing refusal to engage in activities.    that would involve exposure to the phobic object or situation (e.g., repeated refusal to ac-.    cept offers for work-related travel because of fear of flying) may be  helpful in confirming.    the diagnosis in the absence of overt anxiety or panic. .    The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to th e actual danger that the object or situation.    poses, or more intense than is deemed necess ary (Criterion D). Although individuals with.    specific phobia often recognize their reactions as disproportionate, th ey tend to overesti-.    mate the danger in their feared situations, an d thus the judgment of being out of propor-.    tion is made by the cl inician. The individual ’s sociocultural contex t should also be taken.    into account. For example, fears of the dark may be reasonable in a context of ongoing.    violence, and fear of insects may be more di sproportionate in settings where insects are.    consumed in the diet. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for.    6 months or more (Criterion E), which helps distinguish the disorder from transient fears.    that are common in the popu lation, particularly among children.

Although the prevalence of specific phobia is lower in older populations, it remains.    one of the more commonly experienced disorders in late life. Several issues should be con-.    sidered when diagnosing specific phobia in  older populations. Fi rst, older individuals.    may be more likely to endorse natural envi ronment specific phobias, as well as phobias of.    falling. Second, specific phobia (like all anxiet y disorders) tends to co-occur with  medical.    concerns in older individuals, including co ronary heart disease and chronic obstructive.    pulmonary disease. Third, older individuals may be more likely to attribute the symptoms.    of anxiety to medical conditions. Fourth, olde r individuals may be more likely to manifest.    anxiety in an atypical manner (e.g., involvin g symptoms of both anxiety and depression).    and thus be more likely to warrant a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder. Addition-.    ally, the presence of specific phobia in olde r adults is associated with decreased quality of.    life and may serve as a risk factor for major neurocognitive disorder. .    Although most specific phobias develop in ch ildhood and adolescence, it is possible for a.    specific phobia to develop at any age, often as the result of expe riences that are traumatic. For.    example, phobias of choking almost always follow a near-choking event at any age. .    Risk and Prognostic Factors .    Temperamental. Temperamental risk factors for specif ic phobia, such as negative affec-.    tivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition, are risk factors for ot her anxiety disorders as.    well. .    Environmental. Environmental risk factors for specif ic phobias, such as parental over-.    protectiveness, parental loss and separation, and physical and sexual abuse, tend to pre-.    dict other anxiety disorders as well. As note d earlier, negative or traumatic encounters.    with the feared object or situation sometime s (but not always) precede the development of.    specific phobia. .    Genetic and physiological. There may be a genetic suscepti bility to a certain category of.    specific phobia (e.g., an individual with a first-degree relative with a specific phobia of an-.    imals is significantly more likely to have the same specific phobia than any other category.    of phobia).

Suicide Risk .    Individuals with specific phobia are up to 60 % more likely to make a suicide attempt than.    are individuals without the diagnosis. However, it is likely that these elevated rates are.    primarily due to como rbidity with personality disorder s and other anxiety disorders. .    Functional Consequences of Specific Phobia.    Individuals with specific phobia show simi lar patterns of impairment in psychosocial.    functioning and decreased quality of life as individuals with other anxiety disorders and.    alcohol and substance use disorders, includ ing impairments in occupational and inter-.    personal functioning. In older adults, impair ment may be seen in caregiving duties and.    volunteer activities.

Differential Diagnosis.    Agoraphobia. Situational specific phobia may resemble agoraphobia in its clinical pre-.    sentation, given the overlap in feared situations (e.g., flying, enclosed places, elevators). If.    an individual fears only one of the agorapho bia situations, then sp ecific phobia, situa-.    tional, may be diagnosed. If two or more agoraphobic situations are feared, a diagnosis of.    agoraphobia is likely warranted. For example,  an individual who fears airplanes and ele-.    vators (which overlap with the “public transportation” ag oraphobic situation) but does.    not fear other agoraphobic situations would be diagnosed with specific phobia, situa-.    tional, whereas an individual who fears airplanes, elevators, and crowds (which overlap.    with two agoraphobic situations, “using public transportation” and “standing in line and.    or being in a crowd”) would be diagnosed wi th agoraphobia.

Performance fears.    may also manifest in work, school, or academic  settings in which regular public presenta-.    tions are required. Individuals with performance only social anxiety disorder do not fear.    or avoid nonperformanc e social situations. .    Diagnostic Features.    The essential feature of social an xiety disorder is a marked, or in tense, fear or anxiety of so-.    cial situations in which the individual may be scrutinized by others. In children the fear or.    anxiety must occur in p eer settings and not just during in teractions with adults (Criterion.    A). When exposed to such social situations, the individual fears that he or she will be neg-.    atively evaluated. The individu al is concerned that he or she will be judged as anxious,.    weak, crazy, stupid, boring, intimidating, dirt y, or unlikable. The individual fears that.    he or she will act or appear in a certain way or show anxiety symptoms, such as blushing,.    trembling, sweating, stumbling over one’s words, or staring, that will be negatively eval-.    uated by others (Criterion B). Some individuals fear offending others or being rejected as.    a result. Fear of offending others—for exampl e, by a gaze or by showing anxiety symp-.    toms—may be the predominant fear in individu als from cultures with strong collectivistic.    orientations. An individual with fear of tr embling of the hands ma y avoid drinking, eat-.    ing, writing, or pointing in public; an individual with fear of sweating may avoid shaking.    hands or eating spicy foods; and an individual with fear of blushing may avoid public per-.    formance, bright lights,  or discussion about intimate to pics. Some individuals fear and.    avoid urinating in public restrooms when other individuals are present (i.e., paruresis, or.    “shy bladder syndrome”). .    The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Thus, an in-.    dividual who becomes anxious only occasionally in the social situatio n(s) would not be di-.    agnosed with social anxiety di sorder. However, the degree an d type of fear and anxiety.    may vary (e.g., anticipatory anxiety, a panic attack) across different occasions. The antici-.    patory anxiety may occur sometimes far in adva nce of upcoming situations (e.g., worrying.    every day for weeks before attending a social ev ent, repeating a speech for days in advance)"}]}

The fear or anxiety is judged to be out of proportion to the actual risk of being nega-.    tively evaluated or to the consequences of su ch negative evaluation  (Criterion E). Some-.    times, the anxiety may not be judged to be excessive, because it is related to an actual.    danger (e.g., being bullied or tormented by ot hers). However, individuals with social anx-.    iety disorder often overestimate the negative  consequences of social situations, and thus.    the judgment of being out of proportion is ma de by the clinician. The individual’s socio-.    cultural context needs to be taken into account when this judgment is being made. For ex-.    ample, in certain cultures, behavior that mi ght otherwise appear socially anxious may be.    considered appropriate in social situations (e .g., might be seen as a sign of respect)"}]}

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis.    Individuals with social anxiety disorder may be inadequately assertive or excessively sub-.    missive or, less commonly, highly controlling of the conversation.

These in-.    dividuals may be shy or withdrawn, and they may be less open in conversations and dis-.    close little about themselves.

They may live at home longer. Men may be delayed in marrying and having.    a family, whereas women who would want to work outside the home may live a life as.    homemaker and mother. Self-medication with substances is common (e.g., drinking be-.    fore going to a party).

States, this type of panic attack has been es timated to occur at leas t one time in roughly.    one-quarter to one-third of individuals with  panic disorder, of whom the majority also.    have daytime panic attacks. In addition to  worry about panic attacks and their conse-.    quences, many individuals with panic disorder report constant or intermittent feelings of.    anxiety that are more broadly related to heal th and mental health concerns. For example,.    individuals with panic disorder often antici pate a catastrophic outc ome from a mild phys-.    ical symptom or medication side effect (e.g., thinking that they may have heart disease or.    that a headache means presence of a brain tumo r). Such individuals often are relatively in-.    tolerant of medication side effects. In ad dition, there may be pe rvasive concerns about.    abilities to complete daily tasks or withstand daily stressors, excessive use of drugs (e.g.,.    alcohol, prescribed medications or illicit drugs)  to control panic attacks, or extreme behav-.    iors aimed at controlling panic attacks (e.g., seve re restrictions on food intake or avoidance.    of specific foods or medications because of concerns about physical symptoms that pro-.    voke panic attacks). .    Prevalence.    In the general population, the 12-month prevalen ce estimate for panic disorder across the.    United States and several European countries is about 2%–3% in adults and adolescents. In.    the United States, significantly lower rates of  panic disorder are reported among Latinos,.    African Americans, Caribbean blacks, and As ian Americans, compared with non-Latino.    whites; American Indians, by contrast, have significantly higher rates. Lower estimates.    have been reported for Asian,  African, and Latin American countries, ranging from 0.1%.    to 0.8%. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1. The.    gender differentiation occurs in adolescence and is already observable before age 14 years"}]}

Environmental. Reports of childhood experiences of  sexual and physical abuse are more.    common in panic disorder than in certain othe r anxiety disorders.

Genetic and physiological. It is believed that multiple genes confer vulnerability to panic.    disorder. However, the exact genes, gene prod ucts, or functions related to the genetic re-.    gions implicated remain unknown.

Thes e individuals tend to differ from those with-.    out a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD sy mptoms, comorbidity, course,.    and pattern of fam ilial transmission. .    Diagnostic Features.    The characteristic symptoms of OCD are the pr esence of obsessions and compulsions (Cri-.    terion A). Obsessions  are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images.    (e.g., of violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone) . Importantly, obsessions.    are not pleasurable or experi enced as voluntary: they ar e intrusive and unwanted and.    cause marked distress or anxiety in most indi viduals. The individual attempts to ignore or.    suppress these obsessions (e.g., avoiding tri ggers or using thought suppression) or to neu-.    tralize them with another thought or ac tion (e.g., performing a compulsion). Compulsions.    (or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting,.    repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an.    obsession or according to rules that must be  applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD.    have both obsessions and compulsions. Comp ulsions are typically performed in response.    to an obsession (e.g., thoughts of contaminatio n leading to washing rituals or that some-.    thing is incorrect leading to repeating rituals unt il it feels “just right”). The aim is to reduce.    the distress triggered by obsessions or to pr event a feared event (e.g., becoming ill). How-.    ever, these compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g.,.    arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm  to a loved one) or are clearly excessive.    (e.g., showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some.    individuals experience relief from anxiety or distress. .    Criterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (e.g.,.    more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment to warrant.    a diagnosis of OCD. This criterion helps to distinguish the disorder from the occasional in-.    trusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that  are common in the general population (e.g.,.    double-checking that a door is locked). The frequency and severity of obsessions and com-.    pulsions vary across individuals with OCD (e.g., some have mild to moderate symptoms,.    spending 1–3 hours per day obsessing or doin g compulsions, where as others have nearly.    constant intrusive thoughts or comp ulsions that can be  incapacitating)"}]}

Some individuals also  have difficulties discarding.    and accumulate (hoard) object s as a consequence of typical obsessions and compulsions,.    such as fears of harming othe rs. These themes occur across different cultures, are rela-.    tively consistent over time in adults with th e disorder, and may be as sociated with differ-.    ent neural substrates. Importantly, individu als often have symptoms  in more than one.    dimension. .    Individuals with OCD experience a range of  affective responses when confronted with.    situations that trigger obsessions and compul sions. For example, many individuals expe-.    rience marked anxiety that can include recurren t panic attacks. Others report strong feel-.    ings of disgust. While perfor ming compulsions, some individuals report a distressing.    sense of “incompleteness” or uneasiness unt il things look, feel, or sound “just right.” .    It is common for individuals with the disorder to avoid people, places, and things that.    trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, individuals with contamination con-.    cerns might avoid public situat ions (e.g., restaurants, public  restrooms) to reduce ex-.    posure to feared contaminants; individuals with intrusive thoughts about causing harm.    might avoid social interactions. .    Prevalence.    The 12-month prevalence of OCD in the United St ates is 1.2%, with a similar prevalence in-.    ternationally (1.1%–1.8%). Females are affected  at a slightly higher rate than males in.    adulthood, although males are more commonly affected in childhood. .    Development and Course.    In the United States, the mean age at onset of OCD is 19.5 years, and 25% of cases start by.    age 14 years. Onset after age 35 years is unusual but does occur. Males have an earlier age.    at onset than females: nearly 25% of males have onset before age 10 years.

Functional Consequences of .    Obsessive-Compu lsive Disorder.    OCD is associated with reduced quality of life as  well as high levels of social and occupa-.    tional impairment. Impairment occurs across many different domains of life and is asso-.    ciated with symptom severity. Impairment can be caused by the time spent obsessing and.    doing compulsions. Avoi dance of situations that can tr igger obsessions or compulsions.    can also severely restrict functioning. In addition, specific sympto ms can create specific.    obstacles. For example, obsessions about harm can make relationships with family and.    friends feel hazardous; the result can be av oidance of these rela tionships. Obsessions.    about symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or work projects because the.    project never feels “just right,” potentially resulting in school failure or job loss. Health.    consequences can also occur. For example, individuals with contamination concerns may.    avoid doctors’ offices and hospit als (e.g., because of fears of exposure to germs) or develop.    dermatological problems (e.g., skin lesion s due to excessive washing). Sometimes the.    symptoms of the disorder inte rfere with its own treatment (e .g., when medications are con-.    sidered contaminated).

Females and males appear to have more similariti es than differences in terms of most clin-.    ical features— for example, di sliked body areas, types of repetitive behaviors, symptom.    severity, suicidality, comorbidity, illness course, and receipt of cosmetic procedures for.    body dysmorphic disorder. However, males ar e more likely to have genital preoccupa-.    tions, and females are more likely to have a comorbid eating disord er. Muscle dysmorphia.    occurs almost exclusively in males. .    Suicide Risk.    Rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attemp ts are high in both adults and children/ado-.    lescents with body dysmorphic disorder. Furthe rmore, risk for suicide appears high in ad-.    olescents. A substantial proportion of individuals attribute suicidal ideation or suicide.    attempts primarily to their appearance concerns. Individuals with body dysmorphic dis-.    order have many risk factors for completed suic ide, such as high rates of suicidal ideation.    and suicide attempts, demographic characterist ics associated with suicide, and high rates.    of comorbid major depressive disorder. .    Functional Consequences of .    Body Dysmorphic Disorder.    Nearly all individuals with body dysmorphic disorder experience impaired psychosocial.    functioning because of their appearance concerns. Impairment can range from moderate.    (e.g., avoidance of some social situations) to  extreme and incapacitating (e.g., being com-.    pletely housebound). On average, psychosocial functioning and quality of life are mark-.    edly poor. More severe body dysmorphic diso rder symptoms are associated with poorer.    functioning and quality of life. Most individu als experience impairment in their job, aca-.    demic, or role function ing (e.g., as a parent or caregive r), which is often severe (e.g., per-.    forming poorly, missing school  or work, not working). About 20% of youths with body.    dysmorphic disorder report dropping out of school primarily because of their body dys-.    morphic disorder symptoms. Impair ment in social functioning (e.g., social activities, rela-.    tionships, intimacy), includ ing avoidance, is common. In dividuals may be housebound.    because of their body dysmor phic disorder symptoms, some times for years. A high pro-.    portion of adults and adolescents have been psychiatrically hospitalized"}]}

Hair pulling may also be preceded or acco mpanied by various emot ional states; it may.    be triggered by feelings of anxiety or boredo m, may be preceded by an increasing sense of.    tension (either immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the.    urge to pull), or may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the hair is.    pulled out. Hair-pulling behavior may involv e varying degrees of conscious awareness,.    with some individuals displaying more focused attention on the hair pulling (with pre-.    ceding tension and subsequent relief), and other individuals displaying more automatic.    behavior (in which the hair pulling seems to occur without full awareness).

Approximately half of individuals who eventually develop.    PTSD initially present with acute stress diso rder. Symptom worsenin g during the initial.    month can occur, often as a result of ongoin g life stressors or further traumatic events. .    The forms of reexperiencing can vary acro ss development. Unlike adults or adoles-.    cents, young children may report frightening dreams without content that clearly reflects.    aspects of the trauma (e.g., waki ng in fright in the aftermath of the trauma but being unable.    to relate the content of the dream to the traumatic event). Ch ildren age 6 years and younger.    are more likely than older children to expres s reexperiencing symptoms through play that.    refers directly or symbolically to the trauma. For example, a very young child who sur-.    vived a fire may draw pictures of flames. Yo ung children also do not necessarily manifest.    fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or even during reexperiencing. Parents typi-.    cally report a range of emotional expressions,  such as anger, shame, or withdrawal, and.    even excessively bright positiv e affect, in young children who are traumatized. Although.    children may avoid reminders of the trauma, they sometimes become preoccupied with.    reminders (e.g., a young child bitten by a dog may talk about dogs constantly yet avoid go-.    ing outside because of fear of coming into contact with a dog). .    Risk and Prognostic Factors.    Temperamental. Risk factors include prior mental diso rder, high levels of negative af-.    fectivity (neuroticism), greater perceived seve rity of the traumatic event, and an avoidant.    coping style. Catastrophic appraisals of th e traumatic experience, often characterized by.    exaggerated appraisals of future harm, guilt, or hopelessness, are strongly predictive of.    acute stress disorder. .    Environmental. First and foremost, an individual must  be exposed to a traumatic event to.    be at risk for acute stress disorder. Risk fact ors for the disorder include a history of prior.    trauma."}]}

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues.    The profile of symptoms of acute stress disorder may vary cross-culturally, particularly.    with respect to dissociative symptoms, ni ghtmares, avoidance, and somatic symptoms.    (e.g., dizziness, shortness of breath, heat se nsations). Cultural sy ndromes and idioms of.    distress shape the local symptom profiles of acute stress disorder. Some cultural groups.    may display variants of dissociative response s, such as possession or trancelike behaviors.    in the initial month after trauma exposure. Pa nic symptoms may be salient in acute stress.    disorder among Cambodians because of the as sociation of traumatic exposure with panic-.    like khyâl  attacks, and ataque de nervios  among Latin Americans may also follow a traumatic.    exposure. .    Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues.    Acute stress disorder is more prevalent am ong females than among males. Sex-linked neu-.    robiological differences in stre ss response may contribute to females’ increased risk for.    acute stress disorder. The increased risk for the disorder in females may be attributable in.    part to a greater likelihood of exposure to th e types of traumatic events with a high con-.    ditional risk for acute stress  disorder, such as rape and other interpersonal violence. .    Functional Consequences of Acute Stress Disorder.    Impaired functioning in social, interpersona l, or occupational domains has been shown.    across survivors of accidents, assault, and rape  who develop acute stress disorder. The ex-.    treme levels of anxiety that may be associa ted with acute stress disorder may interfere.    with sleep, energy levels, and capacity to a ttend to tasks. Avoidance in acute stress dis-.    order can result in generalized withdrawal from many situations that are perceived as.    potentially threatening, which can lead to nonattendance of medical appointments, avoid-.    ance of driving to important appointments, and absenteeism from work. .    Differential Diagnosis.    Adjustment disorders. In acute stress disorder, the stress or can be of any severity rather.    than of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress di sorder. The diagnosis of.    an adjustment disorder is used when the response to a Criterion A event does not meet the cri-.    teria for acute stress disorder (o r another specific mental diso rder) and when the symptom pat-.    tern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet Criterion A for.    exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual  violence (e.g., spouse leaving,.    being fired). For example, severe  stress reactions to life-threate ning illnesses that may include.    some acute stress disorder symptoms may be more appropriately desc ribed as an adjustment.    disorder. Some forms of acute stress response do not include acute stress disorder symptoms.    and may be characterized by anger, depression, or guilt. These responses are more appro-.    priately described as primarily an adjustment disorder. Depressive or anger responses in an.    adjustment disorder may involve rumination ab out the traumatic event, as opposed to invol-.    untary and intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder"}]}

Differential Diagnosis.    Illness anxiety disorder. Although individuals with depersonalization/derealization dis-.    order can present with vague somatic complaints as well as fears of permanent brain dam-.    age, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by the.    presence of a constellation of typical depersonalization/derealization symptoms and the ab-.    sence of other manifestations  of illness anxiety disorder. .    Major depressive disorder. Feelings of numbness, deadne ss, apathy, and being in a.    dream are not uncommon in major depressive  episodes. However, in depersonalization/.    derealization disorder, such symptoms are a ssociated with further symptoms of the dis-.    order. If the depersonalization/derealization clearly precedes the onset of a major depres-.    sive episode or clearly continues after its resolution, the diagnosis of depersonalization/.    derealization disorder applies. .    Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some individuals with depersonalization/dereal-.    ization disorder can become obsessively preo ccupied with their subjective experience or.    develop rituals checking on the status of their symptoms. However, other symptoms of.    obsessive-compulsive disorder  unrelated to depersonali zation/derealization are not.    present. .    Other dissociative disorders. In order to diagnose depersonalization/derealization.    disorder, the symptoms should not occur in th e context of another dissociative disorder,.    such as dissociative identity disorder. Differentiation from dissociative amnesia and con-.    version disorder (functional neurological sy mptom disorder) is simpler, as the symptoms.    of these disorders do not overlap with those of depersonalization/derealization disorder. .    Anxiety disorders. Depersonalization/derealization is one of the symptoms of panic at-.    tacks, increasingly common as panic attack severity increases. Therefore, depersonal-.    ization/derealization disorder should not be diagnosed when the symptoms occur only.    during panic attacks that are part of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, or specific.    phobia. In addition, it is not uncommon for depersonalization/derealization symptoms.    to first begin in the context of new-onset pani c attacks or as panic disorder progresses and.    worsens. In such presentations, the diagno sis of depersonalization/ derealization disorder.    can be made if 1) the depersonalization/de realization component of  the presentation is.    very prominent from the start, clearly exceed ing in duration and intensity the occurrence.    of actual panic attacks; or 2) the depersona lization/derealization continues after panic dis-.    order has remitted or has be en successfully treated. .    Psychotic disorders. The presence of intact reality testing specifically regarding the.    depersonalization/derealization symptoms is essential to differentiating depersonal-.    ization/derealization disord er from psychotic disorder s. Rarely, positive-symptom.    schizophrenia can pose a diagnostic challenge when nihilistic delusions are present.

Individuals with  persistent insomnia may also acquire maladapt ive sleep habits.    (e.g., spending excessive time in bed; following an erratic sleep schedule; napping) and.    cognitions (e.g., fear of sleeplessness; apprehensions of daytime impairments; clock mon-.    itoring) during the course of the disorder.

In primary care settings, approximately 10%–20% of individuals complain.    of significant insomnia symp toms. Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among fe-.    males than among males, with a gender ratio of about 1.44:1. Although insomnia can be a.    symptom or an independent disorder, it is mo st frequently observed as a comorbid con-.    dition with another medical condition or ment al disorder. For instance, 40%–50% of indi-.    viduals with insomnia also present with a comorbid mental disorder. .    Development and Course.    The onset of insomnia symptoms  can occur at any time during life, but the first episode is.    more common in young adulthood. Less frequently, insomnia begins in childhood or ad-.    olescence. In women, new-onset insomnia may occur during menopause and persist even.    after other symptoms (e.g., hot flashes) have resolved. Insomnia may have a late-life onset,.    which is often associated with the onse t of other health-related conditions. .    Insomnia can be situational, persistent, or recurrent. Situational or  acute insomnia usu-.    ally lasts a few days or a few weeks and is often associated with life events or rapid changes.    in sleep schedules or environment. It usually resolves once the initial precipitating event.    subsides. For some individuals, perhaps those more vulnerable to sl eep disturbances, in-.    somnia may persist long after the initial trigge ring event, possibly because of conditioning.    factors and heightened arousal. The factors that precipitate insomnia may differ from.    those that perpetuate it. For example, an in dividual who is bedridden with a painful injury.    and has difficulty sleeping may then develop negative associations for sleep. Conditioned.    arousal may then persist and lead to persiste nt insomnia. A similar course may develop in.    the context of an acute psychological stress or a mental disorder. For instance, insomnia that.    occurs during an episode of major depressive disorder can become a focus of attention,.    with consequent negative conditioning, and pe rsist even after resolution of the depressive.    episode. In some cases, insomnia may also have an insidious onse t without any identifi-.    able precipitating factor. .    The course of insomnia may also be episodic,  with recurrent episodes of sleep difficul-.    ties associated with the occurrence of stress ful events. Chronicity rates range from 45%.    to 75% for follow-ups of 1–7 years. Even wh en the course of the insomnia has become.    chronic, there is night-to -night variability in sleep patterns, with an occasional restful night’s.    sleep interspersed with several nights of poor sleep. The characteristics of insomnia may.    also change over time. Many individuals with insomnia have a history of “light” or easily.    disturbed sleep prior to onset of more persistent sleep problems"}]}

Functional Consequences of Hypersomnolence Disorder.    The low level of alertness that occurs while an individual fights the need for sleep can lead.    to reduced efficiency, diminished concentration, and poor memory during daytime activ-.    ities. Hypersomnolence can lead to significan t distress and dysfunction in work and social.    relationships.

Differential Diagnosis.    Normative variation in sleep. “Normal” sleep duration varies considerably in the general.    population. “Long sleepers” (i.e., individuals who require a greater than average amount.    of sleep) do not have excessive sleepiness, sleep  inertia, or automatic behavior when they.    obtain their required amount of nocturnal sleep .

The diagnosis of non-24-hour sleep-wake type  is based primarily on a history of symp-.    toms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness related to abnormal synchronization between the.    24-hour light-dark cycle and the endogenous circadian rhythm.

Im-.    pairment in children and adolescents is mani fested more often in behavioral and educa-.    tional domains. .    Risk and Prognostic Factors .    Genetic and physiological. Predisposing factors includ e female gender, advancing.    age, genetic risk variants, an d family history of RLS. Precipitating factors are often time-.    limited, such as iron defici ency, with most individuals resuming normal sleep patterns.    after the initial triggering even t has disappeared. Genetic risk variants also play a role in.    RLS secondary to such disorder s as uremia, suggesting that individuals with a genetic sus-.    ceptibility develop RLS in the presence of further risk factors. RLS has a strong familial.    component. .    There are defined pathophysi ological pathways subserving RLS. Genome-wide asso-.    ciation studies have found that RLS is significantly associated with common genetic vari-.    ants in intronic or intergenic regions in MEIS1 , BTBD9 , and MAP2K5  on chromosomes 2p,.    6p, and 15q, respectively. The ass ociation of these three varian ts with RLS has been inde-.    pendently replicated. BTBD9  confers a very large (80%) exce ssive risk when even a single.    allele is present. Because of the high frequenc y of this variant in individuals of European.    descent, the population attributable risk (P AR) approximates 50%. At-risk alleles associ-.    ated with MEIS1  and BTBD9  are less common in individuals of African or Asian descent,.    perhaps suggesting lower risk fo r RLS in these populations. .    Pathophysiological mechanisms in RLS also in clude disturbances in the central dopa-.    minergic system and disturbances in iron  metabolism. The endo genous opiate system.    may also be involved. Treatment effect s of dopaminergic drugs (primarily D2 and D3 non-.    ergot agonists) provide further support that  RLS is grounded in dysfunctional central.    dopaminergic pathways. While the effective treatment of RLS has also been shown to sig-.    nificantly reduce depressive symptoms, seroto nergic antidepressants can induce or aggra-.    vate RLS in some individuals. .    Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues.    Although RLS is more prevalent in females than  in males, there are no diagnostic differ-.    ences according to gender. However, the prev alence of RLS during pregnancy is two to.    three times greater than in the general population. RLS associated with pregnancy peaks.    during the third trimester and improves or reso lves in most cases soon after delivery. The.    gender difference in prevalence of RLS is explai ned at least in part by parity, with nullipa-.    rous females being at the same r isk of RLS as age-matched males"}]}

The most common conse-.    quences of RLS are sleep disturbance, includ ing reduced sleep time , sleep fragmentation,.    and overall disturbance; depression, generalize d anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and post-.    traumatic stress disorder; and quality-of-life impairments. RLS can result in daytime sleep-.    iness or fatigue and is frequently accompanied by significant distress or impairment in.    affective, social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or cognitive functioning. .    Differential Diagnosis .    The most important conditions in the differential diagnosis of RLS are leg cramps, posi-.    tional discomfort, arthralgias/arthritis, myalgias, positional ischemia (numbness), leg.    edema, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy,  and habitual foot tapping. “Knotting” of.    the muscle (cramps), relief with a single postural shift, limitation to joints, soreness to pal-.    pation (myalgias), and other abnormalities on physical exam ination are not characteristic.    of RLS. Unlike RLS, nocturnal leg cramps do not typically present with the desire to move.    the limbs nor are there frequent limb movements.  Less common conditions to be differen-.    tiated from RLS include neuroleptic-induced akathisia, myelopathy, symptomatic venous.    insufficiency, peripheral artery disease, ec zema, other orthopedic problems, and anxiety-.    induced restlessness. Worsening at night an d periodic limb movements are more common.    in RLS than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy. .    While is it important that RLS symptoms not be solely accounted for by another medical.    or behavioral condition, it should also be appreciated that any of thes e similar conditions can.    occur in an individual with RLS. This necessi tates a separate focus on each possible condi-.    tion in the diagnostic process and when assessing impact. For cases in which the diagnosis of.    RLS is not certain, evaluation for the supportive features of RLS, particularly PLMS or a fam-.    ily history of RLS, may be helpful.

However, individuals.    with the disorder who show the angry/irrita ble mood symptoms typically show the be-.    havioral features as well. .    The symptoms of oppositional  defiant disorder may be confined to only one setting,.    and this is most frequently the home. Indi viduals who show enough symptoms to meet.    the diagnostic threshold, even if it is only at  home, may be significantly impaired in their.    social functioning. However, in more severe cases, the symptoms of the disorder are pres-.    ent in multiple settings. Given that the pervas iveness of symptoms is an indicator of the.    severity of the disorder, it is critical that the individual’s behavior be assessed across mul-.    tiple settings and relationships. Because these behaviors are common among siblings, they.    must be observed during interactions with  persons other than siblings. Also, because.    symptoms of the disorder are ty pically more evident in intera ctions with adults or peers.    whom the individual knows well, they may not be apparent during a clinical examination. .    The symptoms of oppositional defiant disord er can occur to some degree in individu-.    als without this disorder. There are several ke y considerations for de termining if the be-.    haviors are symptomatic of oppo sitional defiant disorder. First, the diagnostic threshold.    of four or more symptoms within the preceding 6 months must be met. Second, the per-.    sistence and frequency of the symptoms should  exceed what is normative for an individ-.    ual’s age, gender, and culture. For example, it is not unusual for preschool children to.    show temper tantrums on a weekly basis. Te mper outbursts for a preschool child would be.    considered a symptom of oppositional defiant d isorder only if they occurred on most days.    for the preceding 6 months, if they occurred with at least three other symptoms of the dis-.    order, and if the temper outbursts contribu ted to the significant impairment associated.    with the disorder (e.g., led to destruction of  property during outbursts, resulted in the.    child being asked to leave a preschool). .    The symptoms of the disorder often are part  of a pattern of pr oblematic interactions.    with others. Furthermore, individuals with this  disorder typically do not regard themselves.    as angry, oppositional, or defian t. Instead, they often justify their behavior as a response to.    unreasonable demands or circumstances. Thus, it can be difficult to disentangle the rela-.    tive contribution of the individual with the disorder to the problematic interactions he or.    she experiences. For example, children with oppositional defiant disorder may have ex-.    perienced a history of hostile parenting, and it is often impossible to determine if the.    child’s behavior caused the parents to act in a more hostile manner toward the child, if the.    parents’ hostility led to the ch ild’s problematic behavior, or if there was so me combination.    of both. Whether or not the clinician can sepa rate the relative contributions of potential.    causal factors should not influence whether or not the diagnosis is made. In the event that.    the child may be living in particularly poor conditions where neglect or mistreatment may.    occur (e.g., in institutional settings), clinical attention to reducing the contribution of the.    environment may be helpful.

Most of these in dividuals become daily tobacco users. Initi-.    ation of smoking after age 21 years is rare.

Alzheimer’s disease, but this difference is larg ely, if not wholly, attr ibutable to greater lon-.    gevity in females. .    Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues.    Individuals’ and families’ level of awareness and concern about neurocognitive symp-.    toms may vary across ethnic and occupational groups. Neurocognitive symptoms are.    more likely to be noticed, particularly at the mild level, in individuals who engage in com-.    plex occupational, domestic, or recreational activities. In addition , norms for neuropsy-.    chological testing tend to be available only for broad populations, and thus they may not.    be easily applicable to individuals with less  than high school ed ucation or those being.    evaluated outside their primary language or culture. .    Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues.    Like age, culture, and occupa tion, gender issues may affect the level of concern and aware-.    ness of cognitive symptoms. In addition, for la te-life NCDs, females are likely to be older,.    to have more medical comorbidity, and to liv e alone, which can complicate evaluation and.    treatment. In addition, there are gender differ ences in the frequency of some of the etio-.    logical subtypes"}]}

Functional Consequences of .    Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders .    By definition, major and mild NCDs affect func tioning, given the central role of cognition in.    human life. Thus, the criteria for the disorder s, and the threshold for differentiating mild.    from major NCD, are based in part on functi onal assessment. Within major NCD there is a.    broad range of functional impairment, as implem ented in the severity specifiers. In addition,.    the specific functions that are compromised can help identify the cognitive domains affected,.    particularly when neuropsychological testing is  not available or is difficult to interpret. .    Differential Diagnosis.    Normal cognition. The differential diagnosis between  normal cognition and mild NCD,.    as between mild and major NCD, is challenging because the boundaries are inherently ar-.    bitrary. Careful history taking and objective as sessment are critical to  these distinctions. A.    longitudinal evaluation using quantified a ssessments may be key in detecting mild NCD"}]}

Diagnostic Features .    Beyond the neurocognitive disorder (NCD) syndro me (Criterion A), the core features of ma-.    jor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease include an insidious onset and gradual pro-.    gression of cognitive and beha vioral symptoms (Criterion B) . The typical presentation is.    amnestic (i.e., with impairment in memory  and learning). Unusual nonamnestic presen-.    tations, particularly visuospa tial and logopenic aphasic vari ants, also exist. At the mild.    NCD phase, Alzheimer’s disease manifests typically with impairment in memory and learn-.    ing, sometimes accompanied by deficits in executive function. At the major NCD phase,.    visuoconstructional/perceptual -motor ability and language w ill also be impaired, partic-.    ularly when the NCD is moderate to severe. Social cognition tends to be preserved until.    late in the course of the disease. .    A level of diagnostic certainty must be sp ecified denoting Alzheimer’s disease as the.    “probable” or “possible” etiology (Criterion C). Probable Alzheimer’s disease  is diagnosed in.    both major and mild NCD if there is evidence  of a causative Alzheimer’s disease gene, ei-.    ther from genetic testing or from an autosomal dominant family history coupled with au-.    topsy confirmation or a genetic test in an affected family member. For major NCD, a.    typical clinical picture, without extended plat eaus or evidence of mixed etiology, can also.    be diagnosed as due to probab le Alzheimer’s disease. For mild NCD, given the lesser de-.    gree of certainty that the deficits will prog ress, these features are only sufficient for a.    possible  Alzheimer’s etiology. If the etiology appe ars mixed, mild NCD due to multiple eti-.    ologies should be diagnosed. In any case, for both mild and major NCD due to Alzhei-.    mer’s disease, the clinical features must no t suggest another primary etiology for the NCD.    (Criterion D). .    Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis.    In specialty clinical settings, approximately 80% of individuals with major NCD due to.    Alzheimer’s disease have behavioral and psyc hological manifestations; these features are.    also frequent at the mild NCD stage of impa irment. These symptoms are as or more dis-.    tressing than cognitive manifestations and ar e frequently the reason that health care is.    sought. At the mild NCD stage or the mildest level of majo r NCD, depression and/or ap-.    athy are often seen. With moderately severe major NCD, psychotic fe atures, irritability,.    agitation, combativeness, and wandering are common. Late in the illness, gait distur-.    bance, dysphagia, incontinence, myoc lonus, and seizures are observed"}]}

HIV disease is caused by infection with hu man immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1),.    which is acquired through exposure to bodily fluids of an infected person through injection.    drug use, unprotected sexual contact, or acci dental or iatrogenic exposure (e.g., contami-.    nated blood supply, needle puncture injury to medical personnel). HIV infects several types.    of cells, most particularly immune cells. Over time, the infection can cause severe depletion.    of “T-helper” (CD4) lymphocytes, resulting in severe immunocompromise, often leading to.    opportunistic infections and neoplasms. This  advanced form of HIV infection is termed.    acquired immune deficiency syndrome  (AIDS). Diagnosis of HIV is confirmed by established.    laboratory methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV antibody with.    Western blot confirmation and/or polymera se chain reaction–based assays for HIV. .    Some individuals with HIV infection deve lop an NCD, which generally shows a “sub-.    cortical pattern” with prominently impaired executive function, slowing of processing.    speed, problems with more demanding attentio nal tasks, and difficulty in learning new.    information, but fewer problems with recall of  learned information. In major NCD, slow-.    ing may be prominent. Language difficulties , such as aphasia, are uncommon, although.    reductions in fluency may be observed. HIV pathogenic proc esses can affect any part of.    the brain; therefore, other patterns are possible. "}]}

Depending on stage of HIV disease, approx imately one-third to over one-half of HIV-.    infected individuals have at least mild neuroc ognitive disturbance, but some of these dis-.    turbances may not meet the full criteria for mild NCD. An estimated 25% of individuals.    with HIV will have signs and symptoms that meet criteria for mild NCD, and in fewer than.    5% would criteria for major NCD be met. .    Development and Course .    An NCD due to HIV infection can resolve, improve, slowly worsen, or have a fluctuating.    course. Rapid progression to profound neur ocognitive impairment is uncommon in the.    context of currently available combination antiviral treatment; co nsequently, an abrupt.    change in mental status in an individual with HIV may prompt an evaluation of other.    medical sources for the cognitive change, incl uding secondary infections. Because HIV in-.    fection preferentially affects subcortical regi ons over the course of  illness, including deep.    white matter, the progression of the disorder follows a “subcortical ” pattern. Since HIV.    can affect a variety of brain regions, and the illness can take on many different trajectories.    depending on associated comorbidities and cons equences of HIV, the overall course of an.    NCD due to HIV infection has considerable heterogeneity. A subc ortical neurocognitive.    profile may interact with age over the life course, when psychomo tor slowing and motor.    impairments such as slowed gait may occur as a consequence of other age-related condi-.    tions so that the overall progression ma y appear more pronounced in later life. .    In developed countries, HIV disease is primar ily a condition of adults, with acquisition.    via risky behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, inje ction drug use) beginning in late adolescence.    and peaking during young and middle adulth ood. In developing countries, particularly.    sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV testing and an tiretroviral treatments for pregnant women.    are not readily available, perinatal transmis sion is common. The NCD in such infants and.    children may present primarily as neurodevelopment al delay. As individuals treated for.    HIV survive into older age, additive and in teractive neurocognitive effects of HIV and.    aging, including other NCDs (e .g., due to Alzheimer’s dise ase, due to Parkinson’s dis-.    ease), are possible. .    Risk and Prognostic Factors.    Risk and prognostic factors for HIV infection. Risk factors for HIV infection include injec-.    tion drug use, unprotected sex, and unprotecte d blood supply and othe r iatrogenic factors. .    Risk and prognostic factors for major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to HIV in-.    fection. Paradoxically, NCD due to HIV infection ha s not declined significantly with the.    advent of combined antiretrov iral therapy, although the most  severe presentations (con-.    sistent with the diagnosis of major NCD) ha ve decreased sharply. Contributory factors.    may include inadequate control of HIV in the central nervous system (CNS), the evolution.    of drug-resistant viral strains, the effects of  chronic long-term systemic and brain inflam-.    mation, and the effects of comorb id factors such as aging, drug  abuse, past history of CNS.    trauma, and co-infections, such as with the hepatitis C virus.

The most useful feature in discriminating narcissistic.    personality disorder from histrionic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders, in.    which the interactive styles are coquettish, callous, and needy, respectively, is the grandi-.    osity characteristic of narcissistic personalit y disorder. The relative stability of self-image.    as well as the relative lack of self-destruc tiveness, impulsivity, an d abandonment concerns.    also help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from borderline personality disor-.    der. Excessive pride in achievements, a relative  lack of emotional display, and disdain for.    others’ sensitivities help distinguish narci ssistic personality disorder from histrionic.    personality disorder. Although individuals wi th borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic.    personality disorders may requir e much attention, those with narcissistic personality dis-.    order specifically need that attention to be admiring. Individuals with antisocial and nar-.    cissistic personality disorders share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib, superficial,.    exploitative, and unempathic.

Development and Course.    Adult males with frotteuristic disorder often re port first becoming aware of their sexual in-.    terest in surreptitiously touching unsuspecting persons during late adolescence or emerging.    adulthood. However, children and adolescents may also touch or rub against unwilling oth-.    ers in the absence of a diagnosis of frotteuris tic disorder. Although th ere is no minimum age.    for the diagnosis, frotteuristic disorder can be difficult to di fferentiate from conduct-disor-.    dered behavior without sexual motivation in individuals at younger ages. The persistence of.    frotteurism over time is unclear. Frotteuristic disorder, however, by de finition requires one.    or more contributing factors that may change over time with or without treatment: subjec-.    tive distress (e.g., guilt, shame,  intense sexual frustration, loneliness); psychiatric morbidity;.    hypersexuality and sexual impulsivity; psycho social impairment; and/ or the propensity to.    act out sexually by touching or  rubbing against unconsenting persons. Therefore, the course.    of frotteuristic disorder is like ly to vary with age. As with other sexual preferences, advanc-.    ing age may be associated with decreasing fr otteuristic sexual preferences and behavior. .    Risk and Prognostic Factors.    Temperamental. Nonsexual antisocial behavior and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality.    might be nonspecific risk factors, although the causal relationship to frotteurism is uncertain.    and the specificity unclear. However, frotteurism is a necessary precondition for frotteuristic.    disorder, so risk factors for frot teurism should also increase the rate of frotteuristic disorder. .    Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues.    There appear to be substantially fewer female s with frotteuristic sexual preferences than.    males. .    Differential Diagnosis.    Conduct disorder and antiso cial personality disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents.    and antisocial personality disorder would be  characterized by additional norm-breaking.    and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in touching or rubbing against a.    nonconsenting individual should be lacking. .    Substance use disorders. Substance use disorders, particularly those involving stimu-.    lants such as cocaine and amphetamines, might involve single frotteuristic episodes by in-.    toxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sustained sexual interest in.    touching or rubbing against unsuspecting persons. Hence, recurrent frotteuristic sexual.    fantasies, urges, or be haviors that occur also when the individual is not intoxicated sug-.    gest that frotteuristic d isorder might be present"}]}
