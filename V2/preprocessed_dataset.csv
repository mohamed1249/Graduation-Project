"xliPreface
The American Psychiatric  Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM) is a classification of mental di sorders with associ ated criteria de-
signed to facilitate more reliable diagnoses of  these disorders. With successive editions
over the past 60 years, it has become a standard  reference for clinical practice in the mental
health field. Since a complete description of the underlying pathological processes is not
possible for most mental diso rders, it is important to emph asize that the current diagnos-
tic criteria are the best available descriptio n of how mental disord ers are expressed and
can be recognized by trained clinicians. DSM is intended to serve as a practical, functional,
and flexible guide for organizing information that can aid in the accurate diagnosis and
treatment of mental disorders. It is a tool for clinicians, an essential educational resource
for students and practitioners, and a reference for researchers in the field",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,42
"Although this edition of DSM was designed fi rst and foremost to be a useful guide to
clinical practice, as an official nomenclature it must be applicable in a wide diversity of
contexts. DSM has been used by clinicians and researchers from diff erent orientations (bi-
ological, psychodynamic, cognitive, behavior al, interpersonal, family/systems), all of
whom strive for a common language to commu nicate the essential ch aracteristics of men-
tal disorders presented by their patients. The information is of value to all professionals
associated with various aspects of mental health care, including psychiatrists, other
physicians, psychologists, social workers, nu rses, counselors, forensic and legal special-
ists, occupational and rehabilitation therapists , and other health professionals. The criteria
are concise and explicit and intended to fac ilitate an objective asse ssment of symptom pre-
sentations in a variety of clinical settings—inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consul-
tation-liaison, clinical, private practice, an d primary care—as well in general community
epidemiological studies of mental disorders.  DSM-5 is also a tool for collecting and com-
municating accurate public health statistics  on mental disorder morbidity and mortality
rates. Finally, the criteria and corresponding text serve as a textbook for students early in
their profession who need a structured way to  understand and diagnose mental disorders
as well as for seasoned professionals encounteri ng rare disorders for the first time. Fortu-
nately, all of these uses are mutually compatible",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,42
These diverse needs and interests were take n into consideration in planning DSM-5,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,42
"The classification of disorders is harmoniz ed with the World Health Organization’s Inter-
national Classification of Diseases  (ICD), the official coding system used in the United States,
so that the DSM criteria define disorders identified by ICD diagnostic names and code
numbers. In DSM-5, both ICD-9-CM and ICD- 10-CM codes (the latter scheduled for adop-
tion in October 2014) are attached to the relevant disorders in the classification",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,42
"Although DSM-5 remains a catego rical classification of sepa rate disorders, we recog-
nize that mental disorders do not always fit completely within the boundaries of a single
disorder. Some symptom domains, such as de pression and anxiety, involve multiple di-
agnostic categories and may reflect common underlying vulnerabilities for a larger group
of disorders. In recognition of  this reality, the disorders in cluded in DSM-5 were reordered
into a revised organizational structure meant to stimulate new clinical perspectives. This
new structure corresponds with the organizational arrangement of disorders planned for
ICD-11 scheduled for release in 2015. Other enhancements have been introduced to pro-
mote ease of use across all settings:",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,42
"xlii Preface
•Representation of developmental issues related to diagnosis.  The change in chapter
organization better reflects a lifespan approach, with disorders more frequently diag-
nosed in childhood (e.g., neurodevelopmental  disorders) at the beginning of the man-
ual and disorders more applicable to olde r adulthood (e.g., neurocognitive disorders)
at the end of the manual. Also, within the text, subheadings on development and course
provide descriptions of how disorder pr esentations may change across the lifespan",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,43
"Age-related factors specific to diagnosis (e.g., symptom presentation and prevalence
differences in certain age groups) are also included in the text. For added emphasis,
these age-related factors have been added to  the criteria themselves where applicable
(e.g., in the criteria sets for insomnia di sorder and posttraumati c stress disorder, spe-
cific criteria describe how symptoms might be expressed in children). Likewise, gender
and cultural issues have been integrat ed into the disorders where applicable",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,43
"•Integration of scientific findings from th e latest research in genetics and neuroimag-
ing. The revised chapter structure was informed by recent research in neuroscience and
by emerging genetic linkages between diag nostic groups. Genetic and physiological
risk factors, prognostic indicators, and so me putative diagnostic markers are high-
lighted in the text. This new structure shoul d improve clinicians’ ability to identify di-
agnoses in a disorder spectrum based on common neurocircuitry, genetic vulnerability,
and environmental exposures. 
•Consolidation of autistic disorder, Asperg er’s disorder, and pervasive developmen-
tal disorder into autism spectrum disorder.  Symptoms of these disorders represent a
single continuum of mild to severe impair ments in the two domains of social commu-
nication and restrictive repetitive behaviors/ interests rather than being distinct disor-
ders. This change is designed to improve the se nsitivity and specificity of the criteria for
the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and to identify more focused treatment tar-
gets for the specific impairments identified",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,43
"•Streamlined classification of bi polar and depressive disorders.  Bipolar and depres-
sive disorders are the most co mmonly diagnosed conditions in psychiatry. It was there-
fore important to streamline th e presentation of these disorders to enhance both clinical
and educational use. Rather than separating  the definition of ma nic, hypomanic, and
major depressive episodes from the definition of bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder,
and major depressive disorder as in the prev ious edition, we included all of the com-
ponent criteria within the respective criteria for each disorder. This approach will facil-
itate bedside diagnosis and treatment of these important disorders. Likewise, the
explanatory notes for differentiating bereav ement and major depres sive disorders will
provide far greater clinical guidance than was previously provided in the simple be-
reavement exclusion criterion. The new specifiers of anxious distress and mixed fea-
tures are now fully described in the narrativ e on specifier variations that accompanies
the criteria for these disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,43
"•Restructuring of substance use diso rders for consistency and clarity.  The categories
of substance abuse and substance dependence  have been eliminated and replaced with
an overarching new category of substance use disorders—with the specific substance
used defining the specific disorders. “Depen dence” has been easily confused with the
term “addiction” when, in fa ct, the tolerance and withdrawal that previously defined
dependence are actually very  normal responses to prescr ibed medications that affect
the central nervous system and do not necessar ily indicate the presence of an addiction",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,43
"By revising and clarifying these criteria in  DSM-5, we hope to alleviate some of the
widespread misunderstanding about these issues",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,43
"•Enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders. Given the explo-
sion in neuroscience, neuropsychology, and br ain imaging over the pa st 20 years, it was
critical to convey the current state-of-the-art  in the diagnosis of specific types of disor-
ders that were previously referred to as the “dementias” or organic brain diseases. Bi-
ological markers identified by imaging for vascular and traumatic brain disorders and",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,43

specific molecular genetic fi ndings for rare variants of  Alzheimer’s disease and Hun-
tington’s disease have greatly advanced cl inical diagnoses, and these disorders and
others have now been separated into specific subtypes. 
•Transition in conceptualizing personality disorders. Although the benefits of a more
dimensional approach to personality disorder s have been identified in previous edi-
tions, the transition from a ca tegorical diagnostic system of individual disorders to one
based on the relative distribution of personality traits ha s not been widely accepted. In
DSM-5, the categorical personality disorder s are virtually unchan ged from the previous
edition. However, an alternative “hybrid” model has been proposed in Section III to
guide future research that separates interp ersonal functioning assessments and the ex-
pression of pathological personality traits for six specific disorders. A more dimensional
profile of personality trait expression is also proposed for a trait-specified approach. 
•Section III: new disorders and features.  A new section (Section III) has been added to
highlight disorders that requir e further study but are not sufficiently well established to
be a part of the official classification of me ntal disorders for routine clinical use. Dimen-
sional measures of symptom severity in 13 symptom domains have also been incorpo-
rated to allow for the measurement of symp tom levels of varying severity across all
diagnostic groups. Likewise, the WHO Di sability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), a
standard method for assessing global disabilit y levels for mental disorders that is based
on the International Classification of Functi oning, Disability and Health (ICF) and is ap-
plicable in all of medicine, has been provid ed to replace the more limited Global As-
sessment of Functioning scale. It is our hope that as these measures are implemented
over time, they will provide greater accuracy and flexibility in the clinical description of
individual symptomatic presen tations and associated disability during diagnostic as-
sessments",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,44
"Additional cross-cutting and diagnostic severity measures are available online
(www.psychiatry.org/dsm5), linked to the re levant disorders. In  addition, the Cul-
tural Formulation Interview, Cultural Formulation Interview—Informant Version, and
supplementary modules to the core Cultural  Formulation Interview are also included
online at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,44
"These innovations were designed by the leadin g authorities on mental disorders in the
world and were implemented on the basis of their expert review, public commentary, and
independent peer review. The 13 work group s, under the direction of the DSM-5 Task
Force, in conjunction with other review bodi es and, eventually, the APA Board of Trust-
ees, collectively represent the gl obal expertise of the specialty. This effort was supported
by an extensive base of advisors and by the professional staff of the APA Division of Re-

"5Introduction
The creation  of the fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-5) was a massive undertaking that involv ed hundreds of peop le working toward a
common goal over a 12-year process. Much thought and deliberation were involved in
evaluating the diagnostic criter ia, considering the organization of every aspect of the man-
ual, and creating new features believed to be mo st useful to clinicians. All of these efforts
were directed toward the goal of enhancing th e clinical usefulness of DSM-5 as a guide in
the diagnosis of mental disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,50
"Reliable diagnoses are essential for guidin g treatment recommendations, identifying
prevalence rates for mental health service pl anning, identifying patient groups for clinical
and basic research, and documenting importan t public health information such as mor-
bidity and mortality rates. As the understand ing of mental disorders and their treatments
has evolved, medical, scientific, and clinical professionals have focused on the character-
istics of specific disorders and their im plications for treatment and research. 
While DSM has been the cornerstone of substant ial progress in reliability, it has been well
recognized by both the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the broad scientific com-
munity working on mental diso rders that past science was no t mature enough to yield fully
validated diagnoses—that is, to provide consistent, strong, and objective scientific validators
of individual DSM disorders. The science of mental disorders continues to evolve. However,
the last two decades since DSM-IV was released  have seen real and durable progress in such
areas as cognitive neuroscience , brain imaging, epidemiology, and genetics. The DSM-5 Task
Force overseeing the new edition recognized that research advances will require careful, iter-
ative changes if DSM is to maintain its place as  the touchstone classifi cation of mental disor-
ders. Finding the right balance is critical. Speculative results do not belong in an official
nosology, but at the same time, DSM must evolve in the context of other clinical research ini-
tiatives in the field. One important aspect of this transition derives from the broad recognition
that a too-rigid categorical system does not capt ure clinical experience or important scientific
observations. The results of nu merous studies of comorbidity and disease transmission in fam-
ilies, including twin studies and molecular genetic studies, make strong arguments for what
many astute clinicians have long observed: the boundaries between many disorder “catego-
ries” are more fluid over the li fe course than DSM-IV recognized, and many symptoms as-
signed to a single disorder may occur, at vary ing levels of severity, in many other disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,50
"These findings mean that DSM, like other medi cal disease classifications, should accommo-
date ways to introduce dimens ional approaches to mental di sorders, including dimensions
that cut across current categories. Such an appr oach should permit a more accurate description
of patient presentations and increase the validity of a diagnosis (i.e., the degree to which diag-
nostic criteria reflect the comprehensive mani festation of an underlying psychopathological
disorder). DSM-5 is designed to better fill the need of clinicians, patients, families, and re-
searchers for a clear and concise description of ea ch mental disorder organized by explicit di-
agnostic criteria, supplemented, when approp riate, by dimensional measures that cross
diagnostic boundaries, and a brie f digest of information about th e diagnosis, risk factors, as-
sociated features, research advances, and various expressions  of the disorder. 
Clinical training and experience are needed to use DSM for determining a diagnosis. The
diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behavior s, cognitive functions, personality traits, phys-
ical signs, syndrome combinations, and durations that require clinical expertise to differenti-
ate from normal life variation and transient responses to stress. To facilitate a thorough",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,50
"6 Introduction
examination of the range of symptoms present, DSM can serve clinicians as a guide to identify
the most prominent symptoms that should be assessed when diagnosing a disorder. Although
some mental disorders may have well-defined  boundaries around symptom clusters, scien-
tific evidence now places many, if not most, disorders on a spectrum with closely related dis-
orders that have shared symptoms, shared genetic and environmental risk factors, and
possibly shared neural substrates (perhaps most  strongly established for a subset of anxiety
disorders by neuroimaging and animal models). In short, we have come to recognize that the
boundaries between disorders are more  porous than originally perceived",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,51
"Many health profession and educational groups have been  involved in the development
and testing of DSM-5, including physicians, psychologists, social workers, nurses, counselors,
epidemiologists, statisticians, neuroscientists, and neuropsychologists. Finally, patients, fam-
ilies, lawyers, consumer organizations, and advoca cy groups have all participated in revising
DSM-5 by providing feedback on the mental di sorders described in this volume. Their moni-
toring of the descriptions and explanatory text  is essential to improve  understanding, reduce

The APA first published a predecessor of DSM in 1844, as a statistical classification of in-
stitutionalized mental patients. It was designed to improve co mmunication about the
types of patients cared for in these hospitals.  This forerunner to DSM also was used as a
component of the full U.S. census. After World War II, DSM evolved through four major
editions into a diagnostic classification system for psychiatrists, other physicians, and
other mental health professionals that descri bed the essential features of the full range of
mental disorders. The current ed ition, DSM-5, builds on the go al of its predecessors (most
recently, DSM-IV-TR, or Text Revision, published in 2000) of providing guidelines for di-
agnoses that can inform treatment and management decisions. 
DSM-5 Revision Process
In 1999, the APA launched an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of DSM based on
emerging research that did not support the bo undaries established for some mental disor-
ders. This effort was coordinated with the World Health Organization (WHO) Division of
Mental Health, the World Psychiatric Associat ion, and the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH) in the form of several conferen ces, the proceedings of which were published
in 2002 in a monograph entitled A Research Agenda for DSM-V.  Thereafter, from 2003 to 2008,
a cooperative agreement with the APA and th e WHO was supported by the NIMH, the Na-
tional Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alco-
hol Abuse (NIAAA) to convene 13 internatio nal DSM-5 research planning conferences,
involving 400 participants from 39 countries, to  review the world litera ture in specific diag-
nostic areas to prepare for revision s in developing both DSM-5 and the International Classi-
fication of Diseases,  11th Revision (ICD-11). Reports from  these conferences formed the basis
for future DSM-5 Task Force reviews and set the stage for the new edition of DSM",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,51
"In 2006, the APA named David J. Kupfer, M.D., as Chair and Darrel A. Regier, M.D.,
M.P.H., as Vice-Chair of the DSM-5 Task Fo rce. They were char ged with recommending
chairs for the 13 diagnostic work groups and additional task force members with a multi-
disciplinary range of expertise who would oversee the development of DSM-5. An addi-
tional vetting process was init iated by the APA Board of Trus tees to disclose sources of
income and thus avoid conflicts of interest by task force and work group members. The full
disclosure of all income and research grants  from commercial sources, including the phar-
maceutical industry, in the previous 3 years, the imposition of an income cap from all com-
mercial sources, and the publication of disclosu res on a Web site set a new standard for the",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,51

field. Thereafter, the task force of 28 memb ers was approved in 2007, and appointments of
more than 130 work group members were approved in 2008. More than 400 additional
work group advisors with no voting authority were also approved to participate in the pro-
cess. A clear concept of the next evolutionary stage for the classification of mental disorders
was central to the efforts of the task force an d the work groups. This vision emerged as the
task force and work groups recounted the history of DSM-IV’s classification, its current
strengths and limitations, and strategic directio ns for its revision. An intensive 6-year pro-
cess involved conducting liter ature reviews and secondary an alyses, publishing research
reports in scientific journals, developing dr aft diagnostic criteria, posting preliminary
drafts on the DSM-5 Web site for public comme nt, presenting preliminary findings at pro-
fessional meetings, performing field tr ials, and revising criteria and text. 
Proposals for Revisions 
Proposals for the revision of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria were develo ped by members of the
work groups on the basis of ra tionale, scope of change, expected impact on clinical man-
agement and public health, strength of the su pporting research evidence, overall clarity,
and clinical utility. Proposals encompassed chan ges to diagnostic criteria; the addition of
new disorders, subtypes, an d specifiers; and the deleti on of existing disorders. 
In the proposals for revisions, strengths and weaknesses in the current criteria and no-
sology were first identified. Novel scientific findings over the previous two decades were
considered, leading to the creation of a resear ch plan to assess potential changes through
literature reviews and se condary data analyses. Four princi ples guided the draft revisions:
1) DSM-5 is primarily intended to be a manual to be used by clinicians, and revisions must
be feasible for routine clinical practice; 2)  recommendations for revisions should be guided
by research evidence; 3) where possible, co ntinuity should be maintained with previous
editions of DSM; and 4) no a priori constraints should be placed on the degree of change
between DSM-IV and DSM-5. 
Building on the initial lite rature reviews, work groups identified key issues within
their diagnostic areas. Work  groups also examined broa der methodological concerns,
such as the presence of contra dictory findings within the literature; development of a re-
fined definition of mental disorder; cross-cutting issues relevant to all disorders; and the
revision of disorders categorized in DSM-IV as “not otherwise specified.” Inclusion of a
proposal for revision in Section II was informed by consideration of its advantages and
disadvantages for public health and clinical ut ility, the strength of the evidence, and the
magnitude of the change. New diagnoses and d isorder subtypes and specifiers were sub-
ject to additional stipulations, such as demons tration of reliability (i.e., the degree to which
two clinicians could independently arrive at the same diagnosis for a given patient). Dis-
orders with low clinical utility and weak valid ity were considered for deletion. Placement
of conditions in “Conditions for Further Study” in Section III was contingent on the
amount of empirical evidence generated on the diagnosis, diagnostic reliability or valid-
ity, presence of clear clinical need, an d potential benefit in advancing research",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,52
"DSM-5 Field Trials
The use of field trials to empirically demonstrat e reliability was a noteworthy improvement in-
troduced in DSM-III. The design and implemen tation strategy of the DSM-5 Field Trials rep-
resent several changes over approaches used for DSM-III and DSM-IV, particularly in
obtaining data on the precision of kappa reliabil ity estimates (a statistical measure that assesses
level of agreement between raters that corrects for chance agreement due to prevalence rates)
in the context of clinical settings with high leve ls of diagnostic comorbidity. For DSM-5, field
trials were extended by using two distinctive designs: one in large, diverse medical-academic
settings, and the other in routine clinical practice s. The former capitalized on the need for large
sample sizes to test hypotheses on reliability and clinical utility of a range of diagnoses in a",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,52

variety of patient populations; the latter su pplied valuable information about how proposed
revisions performed in everyday clinical settings among a diverse sample of DSM users. It is
anticipated that future clinical and basic research  studies will focus on the validity of the re-
vised categorical diagnostic criteria and the underlying dimensional features of these disor-
ders (including those now being explored by th e NIMH Research Domain  Criteria initiative)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,53
"The medical-academic field trials were cond ucted at 11 North American medical-academic
sites and assessed the reliability, feasibility, and clinical utility of select revisions, with priority
given to those that represented the greatest degree of change from DSM-IV or those potentially
having the greatest public health impact. The fu ll clinical patient populations coming to each
site were screened for DSM-IV diagnoses or qu alifying symptoms likely to predict several spe-
cific DSM-5 disorders of interest. Stratified sample s of four to seven specific disorders, plus a
stratum containing a representative sample of all other diagnoses, were id entified for each site",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,53
"Patients consented to the study and were randomly assigned for a clinical interview by a cli-
nician blind to the diagnosis, followed by a se cond interview with a clinician blind to previous
diagnoses. Patients first filled out a computer-assisted inventory of cross-cutting symptoms in
more than a dozen psychological domains. These inventories were scored  by a central server,
and results were provided to clinicians before they conducted a typical clinical interview (with
no structured protocol). Clinicians were required to score the presence of qualifying criteria on
a computer-assisted DSM-5 diagnostic checklist, de termine diagnoses, score the severity of the
diagnosis, and submit all data to the central Web-based server. This study design allowed the
calculation of the degree to wh ich two independent clinicians could agree on a diagnosis (us-
ing the intraclass kappa statistic) and the agreement of a single  patient or two different clini-
cians on two separate ratings of cross-cutting symptoms, pers onality traits, disability, and
diagnostic severity meas ures (using intraclass correlation coefficients) along with information
on the precision of these estimates of reliabilit y. It was also possible to assess the prevalence
rates of both DSM-IV and DSM-5 conditions  in the respective clinical populations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,53

"The field trials provided exposure of the proposed DSM-5 diagnoses and dimensional mea-
sures to a wide range of clinicians to assess their feasibility and clinical utility. 
Public and Professional Review
In 2010, the APA launched a unique Web site to  facilitate public and professional input into
DSM-5. All draft diagnostic criteria and prop osed changes in organization were posted on
www.dsm5.org for a 2-month co mment period. Feedback totaled more than 8,000 submis-
sions, which were systematically reviewed by each of the 13 work  groups, whose members,
where appropriate, integrated questions and comments into discussions of draft revisions
and plans for field trial testing. After revisions to the initial draft criteria and proposed
chapter organization, a second posting occurred in 2011. Wo rk groups considered feedback
from both Web postings and the results of th e DSM-5 Field Trials when drafting proposed
final criteria, which were posted on the Web si te for a third and final time in 2012. These
three iterations of external review produced more than 13 ,000 individually signed com-
ments on the Web site that were received and reviewed by the work groups, plus thousands
of organized petition signers for and against so me proposed revisions, all of which allowed
the task force to actively address concerns of DSM users, as well as patients and advocacy
groups, and ensure that clinical utility remained a high priority",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,53

Force to draft the diagnostic criteria and ac companying text. This effort was supported by
a team of APA Division of Research staff an d developed through a network of text coor-
dinators from each work group. The preparation of the text was coordinated by the text
editor, working in close collaboration with th e work groups and under the direction of the
task force chairs. The Scientific Review Comm ittee (SRC) was established to provide a sci-
entific peer review process that was external to that of the work groups. The SRC chair,
vice-chair, and six committee members were charged with reviewing the degree to which
the proposed changes from DSM-IV could be  supported with scientific evidence. Each
proposal for diagnostic revi sion required a memorandum of evidence for change pre-
pared by the work group and accompanied by a summary of supportive data organized
around validators for the proposed diagnostic criteria (i.e., antecedent validators such as
familial aggregation, concurrent validators such as biological markers, and prospective
validators such as response to  treatment or course of illness). The submissions were re-
viewed by the SRC and scored according to the strength of the supportive scientific data",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,54
"Other justifications for change, such as those arising from clinical experience or need or
from a conceptual reframing of diagnostic ca tegories, were generall y seen as outside the
purview of the SRC. The reviewers’ scores, wh ich varied substantially across the different
proposals, and an accompanying brief commen tary were then returned to the APA Board
of Trustees and the work groups  for consideration and response",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,54
"The Clinical and Public Health Committee (CPH C), composed of a chair, vice-chair, and
six members, was appointed to consider additi onal clinical utility, public health, and log-
ical clarification issues for criteria that ha d not yet accumulated the type or level of evi-
dence deemed sufficient for change by the SRC. This review process was particularly
important for DSM-IV disorders with known deficiencies for whic h proposed remedies
had neither been previously considered in the DSM revision process nor been subjected to
replicated research studies. These selected d isorders were evaluated by four to five exter-
nal reviewers, and the blinded results were  reviewed by CPHC members, who in turn
made recommendations to the APA Boar d of Trustees and the work groups. 
Forensic reviews by the members of the APA Council on Psychiatry and Law were con-
ducted for disorders frequently appearing in forensic environments and ones with high
potential for influencing civil and criminal judgments in courtroom settings. Work groups
also added forensic experts as advisors in pertinent areas to complement expertise pro-
vided by the Council on Psychiatry and Law. 
The work groups themselves were charged with the responsib ility to review the entire re-
search literature surrounding a diagnostic area, including old, revised, and new diagnostic cri-
teria, in an intensive 6-year re view process to assess the pros and cons of making either small
iterative changes or major conceptual changes to  address the inevitable reification that occurs
with diagnostic conceptual approaches that pe rsist over several decades. Such changes in-
cluded the merger of previously separate diagno stic areas into more dimensional spectra, such
as that which occurred with autism spectrum disorder, substance use disorders, sexual dys-
functions, and somatic symptom and related di sorders. Other changes included correcting
flaws that had become apparent over time in th e choice of operational criteria for some disor-
ders. These types of changes po sed particular challenges to the SRC and CPHC review pro-
cesses, which were not constructed to evaluate the validity of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,54

"Organizational Structure
The individual disorder definitions that cons titute the operationali zed sets of diagnostic
criteria provide the core of DSM-5 for clinic al and research purpos es. These criteria have
been subjected to scientific re view, albeit to varying degrees , and many disorders have un-
dergone field testing for interrater reliability. In  contrast, the classification of disorders (the
way in which disorders are grou ped, which provides a high-level organization for the man-
ual) has not generally been thought of as scientif ically significant, despite the fact that judg-
ments had to be made when disorders were initially divided into chapters for DSM-III",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,55
"DSM is a medical classification of disorders and as such serves as a historically deter-
mined cognitive schema imposed on clinical an d scientific informatio n to increase its com-
prehensibility and utility. Not surprisingly, as th e foundational science that ultimately led
to DSM-III has approached a half-century in ag e, challenges have begun to emerge for cli-
nicians and scientists alike that are inherent in the DSM structure rather than in the de-
scription of any single disorder. These challenges include high rates of comorbidity within
and across DSM chapters, an exce ssive use of and need to rely on “not otherwise specified”
(NOS) criteria, and a growing inability to integrate DSM disorders with the results of ge-
netic studies and other scientific findings. 
As the APA and the WHO began to plan their respective revisions of the DSM and the
International Classification of Disorders  (ICD), both cons idered the possibility of improving
clinical utility (e.g., by helping to explain a pparent comorbidity) and facilitating scientific
investigation by rethinking the organizational structures of both publications in a linear
system designated by alphanume ric codes that sequence chap ters according to some ra-
tional and relational structure.  It was critical to both th e DSM-5 Task Force and the WHO
International Advisory Group on the revision  of the ICD-10 Section on Mental and Behav-
ioral Disorders that the revisions to the or ganization enhance clinical utility and remain
within the bounds of well-replicated scientific information. Although the need for reform
seemed apparent, it was import ant to respect the state of the science as well as the chal-
lenge that overly rapid change would pose for the clinical and research communities. In
that spirit, revision of the organization was approached as a conservative, evolutionary di-
agnostic reform that would be guided by emer ging scientific evidence on the relationships
between disorder groups. By reordering and regrouping the existing disorders, the re-
vised structure is meant to stim ulate new clinical perspectives  and to encourage research-
ers to identify the psychological and physiologi cal cross-cutting factors that are not bound
by strict categorical designations. 
The use of DSM criteria has the clear virtue of creating a common language for com-
munication between clinicians about the diagno sis of disorders. The official criteria and
disorders that were determined to have accepted clinical applicability are located in Sec-
tion II of the manual. However, it should be noted that these diagnostic criteria and their",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,55
"Introduction 11
relationships within the classification are ba sed on current research and may need to be
modified as new evidence is gathered by fu ture research both within and across the do-
mains of proposed disorders. “Conditions for Further Study,” described in Section III, are
those for which we determined that the scient ific evidence is not yet available to support
widespread clinical use. These diagnostic crit eria are included to highlight the evolution
and direction of scientific advances in these areas to stimulate further research. 
With any ongoing review proces s, especially one of this co mplexity, different viewpoints
emerge, and an effort was made to consider various viewpoints and, when warranted, ac-
commodate them. For example, personality diso rders are included in both Sections II and
III. Section II represents an update of the te xt associated with the same criteria found in
DSM-IV-TR, whereas Section III includes the proposed research model for personality dis-
order diagnosis and conceptualization developed by the DSM-5 Personality and Personality
Disorders Work Group. As this field evolves, it is hoped that both versions will serve clin-
ical practice and research initiatives",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,56
"Harmonization With ICD-11
The groups tasked with revising the DSM and ICD systems shared the overarching goal of
harmonizing the two classifications as much as possible, for the following reasons: 
• The existence of two major classifications of mental disorders hinders the collection and
use of national health statistics, the design of clinical trials aimed at developing new
treatments, and the consideration of global ap plicability of the results by international
regulatory agencies",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,56
"• More broadly, the existence of two classificat ions complicates attempts to replicate sci-
entific results across national boundaries. 
• Even when the intention was to identify identical patient populations, DSM-IV and
ICD-10 diagnoses did not always agree",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,56
"Early in the course of the revisions, it be came apparent that a shared organizational
structure would help harmonize the classificatio ns. In fact, the use of a shared framework
helped to integrate the work of DSM and ICD work groups and to focus on scientific is-
sues. The DSM-5 organization and the proposed linear structure of the ICD-11 have been
endorsed by the leadership of the NIMH Resear ch Domain Criteria (RDoC) project as con-
sistent with the initial overa ll structure of that project",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,56
"Of course, principled disagreements on th e classification of psychopathology and on
specific criteria for certain disorders were expected given the current state of scientific
knowledge. However, most of  the salient differences betw een the DSM and the ICD classi-
fications do not reflect real sc ientific differences, but rather represent historical by-products
of independent committee processes. 
To the surprise of participants in both revi sion processes, large sections of the content
fell relatively easily into place, reflecting real strengths in some areas of th e scientific lit-
erature, such as epidem iology, analyses of comorbidity, twin studies, and certain other ge-
netically informed designs. When disparities emerged, they almost always reflected the
need to make a judgment about where to plac e a disorder in the face of incomplete—or,
more often, conflicting—d ata. Thus, for example, on the ba sis of patterns of symptoms, co-
morbidity, and shared risk factors, attentio n-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was
placed with neurodevelopmental  disorders, but the same data also supported strong ar-
guments to place ADHD within disruptive , impulse-control, and conduct disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,56
"These issues were settled with the preponderance of evidence (most notably validators ap-
proved by the DSM-5 Task Force). The work gr oups recognize, however, that future dis-
coveries might change the placement as well as the contours of individual disorders and,
furthermore, that the simple and linear organi zation that best supports clinical practice",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,56
"12 Introduction
may not fully capture the complexity and hete rogeneity of mental di sorders. The revised
organization is coordinated with the mental and behavioral disorders chapter (Chapter V)
of ICD-11, which will utilize an expanded numeric–alphanumeric coding system. How-
ever, the official coding system in use in the Un ited States at the time  of publication of this
manual is that of the International Classificatio n of Diseases, Ninth Revi sion, Clinical Modifica-
tion (ICD-9-CM)—the U.S. adaptation of ICD-9. International Classificat ion of Diseases, Tenth
Revision, Clinical Modification  (ICD-10-CM), adapted from IC D-10, is scheduled for imple-
mentation in the United States in October 2014. Given the impending release of ICD-11, it
was decided that this iteration, and not ICD-10, would be the most relevant on which to focus
harmonization. However, given that adoption of the ICD-9-CM coding system will remain
at the time of the DSM-5 releas e, it will be necessary to use the ICD-9-CM codes. Further-
more, given that DSM-5’s organizational stru cture reflects the an ticipated structure of
ICD-11, the eventual ICD-11 co des will follow the sequential  order of diagnoses in the
DSM-5 chapter structure more closely. At present, both the ICD-9-CM and the ICD-10-CM
codes have been indicated for each disorder. These codes will not be in sequential order
throughout the manual because they were assigned to complement earlier organizational
structures",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,57
"Dimensional Approach to Diagnosis
Structural problems rooted in the basic de sign of the previous DSM classification, con-
structed of a large number of narrow diagnostic categories, have emerged in both clinical
practice and research. Relevant evidence come s from diverse sources, including studies of
comorbidity and the substantia l need for not otherwise specified diagnoses, which repre-
sent the majority of diagnoses in areas such as eating disorders, personality disorders, and
autism spectrum disorder. Stud ies of both genetic and environmental risk factors, whether
based on twin designs, familial transmission , or molecular analyses, also raise concerns
about the categorical structure of the DSM system. Because the previous DSM approach
considered each diagnosis as categorically sepa rate from health and from other diagnoses,
it did not capture the widespread sharing of symptoms and risk factors across many dis-
orders that is apparent in studies of comorb idity. Earlier editions of DSM focused on ex-
cluding false-positive results fr om diagnoses; thus, its categories were overly narrow, as is
apparent from the widespread need to use NO S diagnoses. Indeed, the once plausible goal
of identifying homogeneous populations for trea tment and research resu lted in narrow di-
agnostic categories that did not capture clinical reality, symptom heterogeneity within dis-
orders, and significant sharing of symptoms across multiple disorders. The historical
aspiration of achieving diagnostic homogene ity by progressive subt yping within disorder
categories no longer is sensible; like most  common human ills, mental disorders are het-
erogeneous at many levels, ranging fr om genetic risk factors to symptoms. 
Related to recommendations about alteration s in the chapter structure of DSM-5, mem-
bers of the diagnostic spectra study group examined whether scientific validators could
inform possible new groupings of related diso rders within the existing categorical frame-
work. Eleven such indicators were recommended for this purpose: shared neural sub-
strates, family traits, genetic risk factors, sp ecific environmen tal risk factors, biomarkers,
temperamental antecedents, abnormalities of emotional or cognitive processing, symptom
similarity, course of illness, high comorbidit y, and shared treatmen t response. These indi-
cators served as empirical guidelines to info rm decision making by the work groups and
the task force about how to cluster disorders to maximize their validity and clinical utility. 
A series of papers was developed and published in a prominent international journal
(Psychological Medicine,  Vol. 39, 2009) as part of both the DSM-5 and the ICD-11 develop-
mental processes to document that such valid ators were most useful for suggesting large
groupings of disorders rather th an for “validating” individual disorder diagnostic criteria",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,57

disorders and provide a base for future replication wherein data can be reanalyzed over
time to continually assess validity. Ongoing revisions of DSM-5 will make it a “living doc-
ument,” adaptable to future discoveries in  neurobiology, genetics, and epidemiology",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,58
"On the basis of the published findings of this common DSM-5 and ICD-11 analysis, it
was demonstrated that clustering of diso rders according to what has been termed internal-
izing and externalizing  factors represents an empirically  supported framework. Within both
the internalizing group (representing disorder s with prominent anxiety, depressive, and
somatic symptoms) and the externalizing group (representing disorders with prominent
impulsive, disruptive conduct, and substance use symptoms), the sh aring of genetic and
environmental risk factor s, as shown by twin studies, like ly explains much of the system-
atic comorbidities seen in both clinical an d community samples. The adjacent placement of
“internalizing disorders,” characterized by de pressed mood, anxiety, and related physio-
logical and cognitive symptoms, should aid in developing new diagnostic approaches, in-
cluding dimensional approaches, while facilitati ng the identification of biological markers",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,58
"Similarly, adjacencies of the “externalizing group,” including disord ers exhibiting antiso-
cial behaviors, conduct disturbances, addictio ns, and impulse-control disorders, should en-
courage advances in identifying diagnoses, markers, and underlying mechanisms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,58
"Despite the problem posed by categorical diagnoses, the DSM-5 Task Force recognized
that it is premature scientifically to propose alternative definitions fo r most disorders. The
organizational structure is meant to serve as a bridge to new diagnostic approaches with-
out disrupting current clinical practice or  research. With support from DSM-associated
training materials, the National Institutes of  Health other funding agencies, and scientific
publications, the more dimensional DSM-5 approach and organizational structure can fa-
cilitate research across current diagnostic ca tegories by encouraging broad investigations
within the proposed chapters and across adja cent chapters. Such a reformulation of re-
search goals should also keep DSM-5 central to the development of dimensional approaches
to diagnosis that will likely supplement or supersede current categorical approaches in
coming years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,58
"Developmental and Life span Considerations
To improve clinical utility, DSM-5 is organi zed on developmental and lifespan consider-
ations. It begins with diagnoses thought to reflect developmental processes that manifest
early in life (e.g., neurodevelopmental and schizophrenia spectrum  and other psychotic
disorders), followed by diagnoses that more  commonly manifest in adolescence and
young adulthood (e.g., bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders), an d ends with diagno-
ses relevant to adulthood and later life (e.g.,  neurocognitive disord ers). A similar approach
has been taken, where possible, within each chapter. This organizational structure facili-
tates the comprehensive use of lifespan informat ion as a way to assist in diagnostic deci-
sion making. 
The proposed organization of chapters of DSM-5, after the neurodevelopmental disor-
ders, is based on groups of internalizing (emoti onal and somatic) disorders, externalizing
disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and other disorders. It is hoped that this organization
will encourage furthe r study of underlying pathophysiological processes that give rise to
diagnostic comorbidity and sy mptom heterogeneity. Furthermore, by arranging disorder
clusters to mirror clinical reality, DSM-5 shou ld facilitate identifica tion of potential diag-
noses by non–mental health specialist s, such as primary care physicians. 
The organizational structure of DSM-5, alon g with ICD harmonization, is designed to
provide better and more flexible  diagnostic concepts for the next epoch of research and to
serve as a useful guide to clinicians in explai ning to patients why they might have received
multiple diagnoses or why they might have re ceived additional or altered diagnoses over
their lifespan.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,58

"Culture provides interpretive frameworks that  shape the experience and expression of the
symptoms, signs, and behaviors that are criter ia for diagnosis. Culture is transmitted, re-
vised, and recreated within the family and other social systems and institutions. Diagnostic
assessment must therefore consider whether an individual’s experiences, symptoms, and
behaviors differ from sociocultural norms and lead to difficult ies in adaptation in the cul-
tures of origin and in specific social or familial  contexts. Key aspects of culture relevant to di-
agnostic classification and assessment have been considered in the development of DSM-5",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,59
"In Section III, the “Cultural Formulation” contains a detailed discussion of culture and
diagnosis in DSM-5, including tools for in-dep th cultural assessment. In the Appendix, the
“Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress ” provides a description of some common cul-
tural syndromes, idioms of distress, and causal explanations  relevant to clinical practice",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,59
"The boundaries between normalit y and pathology vary across cultures for specific types
of behaviors. Thresholds of tolerance for spec ific symptoms or behaviors differ across cul-
tures, social settings, and fami lies. Hence, the level at which an experience becomes prob-
lematic or pathological  will differ. The judgment that a given behavior is abnormal and
requires clinical attention depends on cultural norms that are internalized by the individual
and applied by others around them, including family members and clinicians. Awareness of
the significance of culture may correct mistaken  interpretations of ps ychopathology, but cul-
ture may also contribute to vulnerability and suffering (e.g., by amplif ying fears that main-
tain panic disorder or health anxiety). Cultural meanings, habits, and traditions can also
contribute to either stigma or support in the social and familial response to mental illness",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,59
"Culture may provide coping strategies that enhance resilience in response to illness, or sug-
gest help seeking and options for accessing heal th care of various types, including alterna-
tive and complementary health systems. Culture may influence acceptance or rejection of a
diagnosis and adherence to treatments, affecting the course of illness and recovery. Culture
also affects the conduct of the cl inical encounter; as a result, cultural differences between the
clinician and the patient have implications fo r the accuracy and acceptance of diagnosis as
well as for treatment decisions, prognost ic considerations, and clinical outcomes",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,59
"Historically, the construct of the culture- bound syndrome has been a key interest of
cultural psychiatry. In DSM-5, this construct h as been replaced by three concepts that offer
greater clinical utility: 
1.Cultural syndrome  is a cluster or group of co-occurr ing, relatively invariant symptoms
found in a specific cultural gr oup, community, or context (e.g., ataque de nervios ). The
syndrome may or may not be recognized as an  illness within the culture (e.g., it might
be labeled in various ways), but such cultural patterns of distress and features of illness
may nevertheless be recognizab le by an outside observer. 
2.Cultural idiom of distress  is a linguistic term, phrase, or  way of talking about suffering
among individuals of a cultural group (e.g.,  similar ethnicity and religion) referring to
shared concepts of pathology and ways of  expressing, communicating, or naming es-
sential features of distress (e.g., kufungisisa ). An idiom of distress need not be associated
with specific symptoms, syndromes, or perceived causes. It may be used to convey a
wide range of discomfort, including everyd ay experiences, subclinical conditions, or
suffering due to social circumstances rather than mental disorders. For example, most
cultures have common bodily idioms of dist ress used to express a wide range of suf-
fering and concerns",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,59
"3.Cultura l explanation or perceived cause  is a label , attribution, or  feature of an explanatory
model that provides a culturally conceived etiology or cause for symptoms, illness, or
distress (e.g., maladi moun ). Causal explanations may be salient features of folk classi-
fications of disease used by  laypersons or healers. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,59
"Introduction 15
These three concepts (for whic h discussion and examples are provided in Section III
and the Appendix) suggest cultural ways of understanding and describing illness experi-
ences that can be elicited in the clinical encounter. They influence symptomatology, help
seeking, clinical presentations, expectations  of treatment, illness adaptation, and treat-
ment response. The same cultur al term often serves more than one of these functions. 
Gender Differences
Sex and gender differences as they relate to th e causes and expression of medical conditions
are established for a number of diseases, including selected mental disorders. Revisions to
DSM-5 included review of potential differenc es between men and women in the expression
of mental illness. In terms of nomenclature, sex differences  are variations attributable to an
individual’s reproductive organs an d XX or XY chromosomal complement. Gender differ-
ences are variations that result from biological sex as well as an individual’s self-represen-
tation that includes the psychological, be havioral, and social consequences of one’s
perceived gender. The term gender differences  is used in DSM-5 because, more commonly,
the differences between men and women are a re sult of both biological sex and individual
self-representation. However, some of the di fferences are based on only biological sex. 
Gender can influence illness in a variety of ways. First, it may exclusively determine
whether an individual is at risk for a disord er (e.g., as in premenstrual dysphoric disor-
der). Second, gender may moderate the overa ll risk for development of a disorder as
shown by marked gender differences in the prevalence and incidence rates for selected
mental disorders. Third, gender may influence the likelihood that particular symptoms of
a disorder are experienced by an individual . Attention-deficit/hype ractivity disorder is
an example of a disorder with differences in  presentation that are most commonly expe-
rienced by boys or girls. Gender likely has other effects on the experience of a disorder that
are indirectly relevant to psychiatric diagnosis. It may be that certain symptoms are more
readily endorsed by men or women, and that this contributes to differences in service pro-
vision (e.g., women may be more likely to recognize a depr essive, bipolar, or anxiety dis-
order and endorse a more comprehen sive list of symptoms than men). 
Reproductive life cycle events, including estr ogen variations, also contribute to gender
differences in risk and expression of illness. Thus, a specifier for postpartum onset of mania
or major depressive episode denotes a time frame wherein women may be at increased risk
for the onset of an illness episode. In the case  of sleep and energy, alterations are often nor-
mative postpartum and thus may have lower diagnostic reliability in postpartum women. 
The manual is configured to include information on gender at  multiple levels. If there
are gender-specific symptoms, th ey have been added to the di agnostic criteria. A gender-
related specifier, such as perinatal onset of a mood episode, provides additional informa-
tion on gender and diagnosis. Finally, other issues that are pertinent to diagnosis and gen-
der considerations can be found in the se ction “Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues.”
Use of Other Specified and Unspecified Disorders
To enhance diagnostic specificity, DSM-5 repl aces the previous NOS designation with two
options for clinical use: other specified disorder  and unspecified disorder.  The other specified
disorder category is provided to allow the clinician to communicate the specific reason
that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific category within a diagnos-
tic class. This is done by recording the name of the category, followed by the specific rea-
son. For example, for an in dividual with clin ically significant depressive symptoms
lasting 4 weeks but whose symptomatology falls short of the diagnostic threshold for a
major depressive episode, the clinician would re cord “other specified depressive disorder,
depressive episode with insufficient symptoms.” If the clinician chooses not to specify the",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,60
"16 Introduction
reason that the criteria are not met for a sp ecific disorder, then “unspecified depressive
disorder” would be diagnosed. Note that th e differentiation between other specified and
unspecified disorders is based on the clinic ian’s decision, providing maximum flexibility
for diagnosis. Clinicians do not have to diff erentiate between other specified and unspec-
ified disorders based on some feature of the presentation itself. When the clinician deter-
mines that there is evidence to specify the na ture of the clinical presentation, the other
specified diagnosis can be given. When the clinician is not able to further specify and de-
scribe the clinical presentation, the unspecifie d diagnosis can be given. This is left entirely
up to clinical judgment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,61

tions, see “Use of the Manual” in Section I",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,61
"The Multiaxial System
Despite widespread use and its adoption by certain insurance and governmental agencies,
the multiaxial system in DSM-IV was not requ ired to make a mental disorder diagnosis. A
nonaxial assessment system was also included that simply listed the appropriate Axis I, II,
and III disorders and conditio ns without axial designations. DSM-5 has moved to a nonax-
ial documentation of diagnosis (formerly Axes I, II, and III), with separate notations for
important psychosocial and contextual factors (formerly Ax is IV) and disability (formerly
Axis V). This revision is consistent with the DSM-IV text that states, “The multiaxial dis-
tinction among Axis I, Axis II, and Axis III disorders does not imply that there are funda-
mental differences in their conceptualizatio n, that mental disorders are unrelated to
physical or biological factors or processes, or  that general medical conditions are unrelated
to behavioral or psychosocial factors or processes.” The approa ch of separately noting di-
agnosis from psychosocial and contextual fact ors is also consistent with established WHO
and ICD guidance to consider the individual’s functional status separately from his or her
diagnoses or symptom status. In DSM-5, Axis  III has been combined with Axes I and II",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,61
"Clinicians should continue to list medical cond itions that are import ant to the understand-
ing or management of an individual’s mental disorder(s)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,61
"DSM-IV Axis IV covered psychosocial and en vironmental problems that may affect the
diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of ment al disorders. Although this axis provided
helpful information, even if it was not us ed as frequently as intended, the DSM-5 Task
Force recommended that DSM-5 should not deve lop its own classification of psychosocial
and environmental problems, bu t rather use a selected set of the ICD-9-CM V codes and
the new Z codes contained in ICD-10-CM. Th e ICD-10 Z codes were examined to deter-
mine which are most relevant to mental  disorders and also to identify gaps. 
DSM-IV Axis V consisted of the Global Assessment of Functionin g (GAF) scale, repre-
senting the clinician's judgment of the individu al’s overall level of “functioning on a hy-
pothetical continuum of ment al health–illness.” It was recommended that the GAF be
dropped from DSM-5 for several reasons, including its conceptual lack of clarity (i.e., in-
cluding symptoms, suicide risk, and disabilities in its descriptors) and questionable psy-
chometrics in routine practice. In order to provide a global measur e of disability, the WHO
Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) is included, for further stud y, in Section III of
DSM-5 (see the chapter “Assessment Measure s”). The WHODAS is based on the Interna-
tional Classification of  Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) for use across all of medicine
and health care. The WHODAS (version 2.0), and a modification developed for children/
adolescents and their parents by the Impairment and Disability Study Group were in-
cluded in the DSM-5 field trial.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,61

"19Use of the Manual
The introduction  contains much of the history and developmental process of the
DSM-5 revision. This section is designed to prov ide a practical guide to using DSM-5, par-
ticularly in clinical practice. The primary purp ose of DSM-5 is to assist trained clinicians
in the diagnosis of their patients’ mental diso rders as part of a case formulation assess-
ment that leads to a fully informed treatmen t plan for each individual. The symptoms con-
tained in the respective diagnostic criter ia sets do not constitute comprehensive
definitions of underlying disorders, which encompass cognitive, emotional, behavioral,
and physiological processes that are far more co mplex than can be described in these brief
summaries. Rather, they are intended to summa rize characteristic syndromes of signs and
symptoms that point to an underlying disord er with a characteristic developmental his-
tory, biological and environmental risk factors, neuropsychological and physiological cor-
relates, and typical clinical course",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,64
"Approach to Clinical Case Formulation
The case formulation for any given patient must  involve a careful clinical history and con-
cise summary of the social, psychological, and biological factors that may have contrib-
uted to developing a given mental disorder. Hence, it is not sufficient to simply check off
the symptoms in the diag nostic criteria to make a mental  disorder diagnosis. Although a
systematic check for the presence of these crit eria as they apply to each patient will assure
a more reliable assessment, the relative severity and valence of in dividual criteria and
their contribution to a diagnosis require clin ical judgment. The symptoms in our diagnos-
tic criteria are part of the relatively limited repertoire of human emotional responses to in-
ternal and external stresses that are genera lly maintained in a homeostatic balance without
a disruption in normal functioning. It requires  clinical training to recognize when the com-
bination of predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and protective factors has resulted
in a psychopathological condition in which physical signs and symptoms exceed normal
ranges. The ultimate goal of a clinical case formulation is to use the available contextual
and diagnostic information in developing a comprehensive treatment plan that is in-
formed by the individual’s cultural and social context. However, recommendations for the
selection and use of the most appropriate ev idence-based treatment options for each dis-
order are beyond the scope of this manual",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,64
"Although decades of scientific effort have go ne into developing the diagnostic criteria
sets for the disorders included in  Section II, it is well recognized  that this set of categorical
diagnoses does not fully describe the full rang e of mental disorders that individuals ex-
perience and present to clinicians on a daily  basis throughout the world. As noted previ-
ously in the introduction, the range of genetic/environmental interactions over the course
of human development affecting cognitive, em otional and behavioral function is virtually
limitless. As a result, it is impossible to capt ure the full range of psychopathology in the
categorical diagnostic categories  that we are now using. Hence,  it is also necessary to in-
clude “other specified/unspecified” disorder  options for presentations that do not fit
exactly into the diagnostic boundaries of disorders in each chapter. In an emergency de-
partment setting, it may be possible to id entify only the most prominent symptom ex-
pressions associated with a particular chap ter—for example, delusions, hallucinations,",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,64

mania, depression, anxiety, substance intoxi cation, or neurocognitive symptoms—so that
an “unspecified” disorder in that category is identified until a fuller differential diagnosis
is possible",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,65
"Definition of a Mental Disorder
Each disorder identified in Section II of the manual (excluding those in the chapters enti-
tled “Medication-Induced Movement Disord ers and Other Adverse Effects of Medica-
tion” and “Other Conditions That May Be a Fo cus of Clinical Attention”) must meet the
definition of a mental disorder. Although no definition can capture all aspects of all dis-
orders in the range contained in DSM-5,  the following elements are required:
A mental disorder is a syndrome characte rized by clinically significant distur-
bance in an individual’s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects
a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes un-
derlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with signif-
icant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,65
"An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss,
such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant be-
havior (e.g., political, religious, or sex ual) and conflicts that are primarily be-
tween the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance
or conflict results from a dysfuncti on in the individual, as described above",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,65
"The diagnosis of a mental disorder should have  clinical utility: it should help clinicians
to determine prognosis, treatment plans, and potential treatment outcomes for their pa-
tients. However, the diagnosis of a mental disorder is not equivalent to a need for treat-
ment. Need for treatment is a complex clinic al decision that takes into consideration
symptom severity, symptom salience (e.g., the pr esence of suicidal ideation), the patient’s
distress (mental pain) associated with the sy mptom(s), disability related to the patient’s
symptoms, risks and benefits of available trea tments, and other factors (e.g., psychiatric
symptoms complicating other illness). Clinicians may thus encounter individuals whose
symptoms do not meet full crit eria for a mental disorder bu t who demonstrate a clear need
for treatment or care. The fact that some in dividuals do not show all symptoms indicative
of a diagnosis should not be used to justify limiting their access to appropriate care",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,65
"Approaches to validating diagnostic criteria  for discrete categorical mental disorders
have included the following types of evidence: antecedent validators (similar genetic mark-
ers, family traits, temperament, and environmen tal exposure), concurrent validators (simi-
lar neural substrates, biomarkers, emotional and cognitive processing, and symptom
similarity), and predictive validators (simila r clinical course and treatment response). In
DSM-5, we recognize that the current diagnostic criteria for any single disorder will not nec-
essarily identify a homogeneous group of patients who can be characterized reliably with all
of these validators. Available evidence shows that these va lidators cross existing diagnostic
boundaries but tend to congregate more frequently within  and across adjacent DSM-5 chap-
ter groups. Until incontrovertible etiological or pathophysiological mechanisms are identi-
fied to fully validate specific disorders or disorder spectra, the most important standard for
the DSM-5 disorder criteria will be their clin ical utility for the assessment of clinical course
and treatment response of individuals groupe d by a given set of diagnostic criteria",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,65
"This definition of mental disorder was developed for clinical, public health, and re-
search purposes. Additional information is usua lly required beyond that contained in the
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria in or der to make legal judgments on  such issues as criminal re-
sponsibility, eligibility for disability compen sation, and competency (see “Cautionary
Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5” elsewhere in this manual).",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,65

Criterion for Clinical Significance
There have been substantial e fforts by the DSM-5 Task Force and the World Health Orga-
nization (WHO) to separate the concepts of mental disorder  and disability (impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning). In the WHO system, the In-
ternational Classification of Diseases (ICD) c overs all diseases and disorders, while the In-
ternational Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a separate
classification of global disability. The WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS)
is based on the ICF and has proven useful as a standardized measure of disability for men-
tal disorders. However, in the absence of clea r biological markers or clinically useful mea-
surements of severity for many mental disord ers, it has not been possible to completely
separate normal and pathological symptom expressions contained in diagnostic criteria",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,66
"This gap in information is particularly problematic in clinical situations in which the pa-
tient’s symptom presentation by itself (particu larly in mild forms) is not inherently path-
ological and may be encountered in individuals for whom a diagnosis of “mental
disorder” would be inappropriat e. Therefore, a generic diagno stic criterion requiring dis-
tress or disability has been used to establish disorder thresholds, usually worded “the dis-
turbance causes clinically significant distre ss or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of functioning.” The text  following the revised definition of a mental
disorder acknowledges that this criterion may be especially helpful in determining a pa-
tient’s need for treatment. Use of informatio n from family members and other third parties
(in addition to the individual) regarding the individual’s perf ormance is recommended
when necessary",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,66
"Elements of a Diagnosis
Diagnostic Criteria  and Descriptors
Diagnostic criteria are offered as guidelines for making diagnoses, and their use should be
informed by clinical judgment. Text descript ions, including introductory sections of each
diagnostic chapter, can help support diagnosis (e.g., providing differential diagnoses; de-
scribing the criteria more fully  under “Diagnostic Features”). 
Following the assessment of diagnostic criter ia, clinicians should consider the applica-
tion of disorder subtypes and/ or specifiers as appropriate. Severity and course specifiers
should be applied to denote the individual’s current presentation, but only when the full
criteria are met. When full criteria are no t met, clinicians should consider whether the
symptom presentation meets crit eria for an “other specified” or “unspecified” designa-
tion. Where applicable, specific criteria for defining disorder severity (e.g., mild, moder-
ate, severe, extreme), descriptive features (e.g.,  with good to fair insight; in a controlled
environment), and course (e.g., in partial remi ssion, in full remission, recurrent) are pro-
vided with each diagnosis. On the basis of the clinical interview, text descriptions, criteria,
and clinician judgment, a final diagnosis is made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,66
"The general convention in DSM-5 is to allo w multiple diagnoses to be assigned for
those presentations that meet criteria  for more than one DSM-5 disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,66
"Subtypes and Specifiers
Subtypes and specifiers (some of which are code d in the fourth, fifth, or sixth digit) are
provided for increased specificity. Subtypes  define mutually exclusive and jointly exhaus-
tive phenomenological subgroupings within a diagnosis and are indicated by the instruc-
tion “ Specify  whether” in the criteria set. In contrast, specifiers  are not intended to be
mutually exclusive or jointly exhaustive, and as a consequence, more than one specifier
may be given. Specifiers are indicated by the instruction “ Specify ” or “Specify if” in the cri-
teria set. Specifiers provide an opportunity to define a more homogeneous subgrouping of",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,66

individuals with the disorder who share certai n features (e.g., major depressive disorder,
with mixed features) and to conv ey information that is relevant to the management of the
individual’s disorder, such as the “with other medical comorbidity” specifier in sleep-
wake disorders. Although a fifth digit is sometimes assigned to code a subtype or specifier
(e.g., 294.11 [F02.81] major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, with be-
havioral disturbance) or severity (296.21 [F32. 0] major depressive disorder, single episode,
mild), the majority of subtypes and specifie rs included in DSM-5 cannot be coded within
the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM systems and are indicated only by including the subtype or
specifier after the name of the disorder (e.g.,  social anxiety disorder [social phobia], per-
formance type). Note that in some cases, a specifier or subtype is codable in ICD-10-CM
but not in ICD-9-CM. Accordingly, in some c ases the 4th or 5th character codes for the sub-
types or specifiers are provided only for the ICD-10-CM coding designations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,67

ous diagnoses from which the individual has recovered shoul d be clearly noted as such",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,67

the diagnosis and are indicated in a numb er of criteria sets. Where available, severity spec-
ifiers  are provided to guide clinicians in rating  the intensity, frequency, duration, symptom
count, or other severity indicator of a disorder . Severity specifiers are indicated by the in-
struction “ Specify  current severity” in the criteria se t and include disorder-specific defini-
tions. Descriptive features specifiers  have also been provided in the criteria set and convey
additional information that can inform trea tment planning (e.g., obsessive-compulsive

Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other 
Conditions That May Be a Fo cus of Clinical Attention
In addition to important psychosocial and en vironmental factors (see “The Multiaxial Sys-
tem” in the “Introduction” elsewhere in this ma nual), these chapters in Section II also con-
tain other conditions that are not mental disorders but may be encountered by mental
health clinicians. These conditions may be listed as a reason for clinical visit in addition to,
or in place of, the mental disorders listed in  Section II. A separate chapter is devoted to
medication-induced disorders and other adverse effects of medication that may be as-
sessed and treated by clinicians in mental health practice such as akathisia, tardive dyski-
nesia, and dystonia. The description of neurol eptic malignant syndrome is expanded from
that provided in DSM-IV-TR to highlight the em ergent and potentially life-threatening na-
ture of this condition, and a new entry on an tidepressant discontinuation syndrome is pro-
vided. An additional chapter discusses other conditions that may be a focus of clinical
attention. These include relational problems, problems related to abuse and neglect, prob-
lems with adherence to treatment regimens, obesity, antisocial behavior, and malingering",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,67
"Principal Diagnosis
When more than one diagnosis for an individual is given in an inpatient setting, the prin-
cipal diagnosis is the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occa-
sioning the admission of the individual. When more than one diagnosis is given for an
individual in an outpatient setting, the reason  for visit is the condition that is chiefly re-
sponsible for the ambulatory care medical servic es received during the visit. In most cases,
the principal diagnosis or the reason for visit is also the main focus of attention or treat-
ment. It is often difficult (and somewhat ar bitrary) to determine which diagnosis is the
principal diagnosis or the reason for visit, especially when, for example, a substance-
related diagnosis such as alcohol use disorder  is accompanied by a non-substance-related
diagnosis such as schizophrenia. For example, it may be unclear which diagnosis should",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,67
"Use of the Manual 23
be considered “principal” for an individual hospitalized with both schizophrenia and al-
cohol use disorder, because each condition ma y have contributed equally to the need for
admission and treatment. The principal diagnosis is indicated by listing it first, and the re-
maining disorders are listed in order of focu s of attention and treatment. When the prin-
cipal diagnosis or reason for visit is a ment al disorder due to another medical condition
(e.g., major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease, psychotic disorder due to
malignant lung neoplasm), ICD coding rules re quire that the etiological medical condition
be listed first. In that case, the principal diagnosis or reason for visit would be the mental
disorder due to the medical condition, the seco nd listed diagnosis. In  most cases, the dis-
order listed as the principal diagnosis or the reason for visit is followed by the qualifying
phrase “(principal diagnosis)” or “(reason for visit).”
Provisional Diagnosis
The specifier “provisional” can be used when there is a strong presumption that the full
criteria will ultimately be met for a disord er but not enough information is available to
make a firm diagnosis. The clinician can indi cate the diagnostic uncertainty by recording
“(provisional)” following the diagnosis. For example, this diagnosis might be used when
an individual who appears to ha ve a major depressive disorder  is unable to give an ade-
quate history, and thus it canno t be established that the full cr iteria are met. Another use of
the term provisional is for those situations in which differential diagnosis depends exclu-
sively on the duration of illness. For example,  a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder re-
quires a duration of less than 6 months bu t of at least 1 month and can only be given
provisionally if assigned before remission has occurred",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,68
"Coding and Reporting Procedures
Each disorder is accompanied by an identify ing diagnostic and statistical code, which is
typically used by institutions and agencies for data collection and billing purposes. There
are specific recording protocol s for these diagnostic codes (i dentified as coding notes in
the text) that were established  by WHO, the U.S. Centers fo r Medicare and Medicaid Ser-
vices (CMS), and the Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention’s National Center for
Health Statistics to ensure co nsistent international recordin g of prevalence and mortality
rates for identified health conditions. For most clinicians, the codes are used to identify the
diagnosis or reason for visit for CMS and private insurance servic e claims. The official
coding system in use in the United States as of publication of this ma nual is ICD-9-CM. Of-
ficial adoption of ICD-10-CM is scheduled to take place on October 1, 2014, and these
codes, which are shown parenthetically in this manual, should not be used until the offi-
cial implementation occurs. Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes have  been listed 1) pre-
ceding the name of the disorder in the classification and 2) accompanying the criteria set
for each disorder. For some diagnoses (e.g ., neurocognitive and substance/medication-
induced disorders), the appropriate code depe nds on further specification and is listed
within the criteria set for the disorder, as coding  notes, and, in some cases, further clarified

"25Cautionary Statement for
Forensic Use of DSM-5
Although the DSM-5  diagnostic criteria and text are primarily designed to assist
clinicians in conducting clinical assessment,  case formulation, an d treatment planning,
DSM-5 is also used as a reference for the cour ts and attorneys in assessing the forensic con-
sequences of mental disorders. As a result, it  is important to note that the definition of
mental disorder included in DSM-5 was developed to meet the needs of clinicians, public
health professionals, and research investigators rather than all of the technical needs of the
courts and legal professionals. It is also im portant to note that DSM-5 does not provide
treatment guidelines for any given disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,70
"When used appropriately, diagnoses and di agnostic information can assist legal deci-
sion makers in their determinations. For exampl e, when the presence of a mental disorder
is the predicate for a su bsequent legal determination (e.g ., involuntary civil commitment),
the use of an established system of diagnosi s enhances the value and reliability of the de-
termination. By providing a co mpendium based on a review of the pertinent clinical and
research literature, DSM-5 may facilitate legal decision makers’ understanding of the rel-
evant characteristics of mental disorders. The literature related to di agnoses also serves as
a check on ungrounded speculation about ment al disorders and about the functioning of a
particular individual. Finally, diagnostic in formation about longitud inal course may im-
prove decision making when the legal issue co ncerns an individual’s mental functioning
at a past or future point in time",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,70
"However, the use of DSM-5 should be inform ed by an awareness of the risks and lim-
itations of its use in forensic settings. When  DSM-5 categories, criteria, and textual descrip-
tions are employed for forensic purposes, ther e is a risk that diagnostic information will be
misused or misunderstood. These dangers aris e because of the imperfect fit between the
questions of ultimate concern to  the law and the information contained in a clinical diagno-
sis. In most situations, the clinical diagnosis of a DSM-5 mental disorder such as intellec-
tual disability (intellectual developmental di sorder), schizophrenia , major neurocognitive
disorder, gambling disorder, or pedophilic di sorder does not imply that an individual
with such a condition meets legal criteria for the presence of a mental disorder or a speci-
fied legal standard (e.g., for co mpetence, criminal responsibility , or disability). For the latter,
additional information is usually required beyond that contained in the DSM-5 diagnosis,
which might include information about the individual’s functional impairments and how
these impairments affect the particular abilities in question. It is precisely because impair-
ments, abilities, and disabilities vary widely wi thin each diagnostic category that assign-
ment of a particular diagnosis does not imply a specific level of im pairment or disability",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,70
"Use of DSM-5 to assess for th e presence of a mental diso rder by nonclinical, nonmed-
ical, or otherwise insufficiently trained indi viduals is not advised. Nonclinical decision
makers should also be cautioned that a di agnosis does not carry any necessary implica-
tions regarding the etiology or causes of the individual’s mental di sorder or the individ-
ual’s degree of control over behaviors that may be associat ed with the disorder. Even
when diminished control over one’s behavior is a feature of the disorder, having the diag-
nosis in itself does not demons trate that a particular individu al is (or was) unable to con-
trol his or her behavior at a particular time.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,70

"31Neurodevelopmental
Disorders
The neurodevelopmental  disorders are a group of co nditions with onset in the
developmental period. The diso rders typically manifest early in development, often be-
fore the child enters grade school, and are characterized by developmental deficits that
produce impairments of person al, social, academic, or occupational functioning. The
range of developmental deficits varies from very  specific limitations of  learning or control
of executive functions to glob al impairments of social skills  or intelligence. The neurode-
velopmental disorders frequent ly co-occur; for example, in dividuals with autism spec-
trum disorder often have intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), and
many children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also have a specific
learning disorder. For some diso rders, the clinical presentation includes symptoms of ex-
cess as well as deficits and delays in achiev ing expected milestones. For example, autism
spectrum disorder is diagnose d only when the characteristic deficits of social communi-
cation are accompanied by excessively repetitive  behaviors, restricted interests, and insis-
tence on sameness. 
Intellectual disability (intel lectual developmental disorder) is characterized by deficits
in general mental abilities, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking,
judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience. The deficits result in impair-
ments of adaptive functioning, such that the individual fails to meet standards of personal
independence and social responsibility in one or more aspects of daily life, including com-
munication, social participation, academic or occupational functionin g, and personal inde-
pendence at home or in community settings . Global developmental delay, as its name
implies, is diagnosed when an individual fa ils to meet expected developmental milestones
in several areas of intellectual functioning. The diagnosis is used for individuals who are
unable to undergo systematic assessments of intellectual functioning, including children
who are too young to participate in standardiz ed testing. Intellectual disability may result
from an acquired insult during the developm ental period from, for example, a severe head
injury, in which case a neurocognitive disorder also may be diagnosed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,76
"The communication disorders include language disorder, speech sound disorder, so-
cial (pragmatic) communication  disorder, and childhood-onset fluency disorder (stutter-
ing). The first three disorders are characterize d by deficits in the development and use of
language, speech, and social communication, respectively. Childhood -onset fluency dis-
order is characterized by disturbances of the normal fluency an d motor production of
speech, including repetitive sounds or syllables, prolongation of consonants or vowel
sounds, broken words, blocking, or words pr oduced with an exce ss of physical tension",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,76

deficits, the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder requires th e presence of restricted, re-

are noted through the use of specifiers (with or without accompanying intellectual impair-
ment; with or without accompan ying structural language im pairment; associated with a
known medical/genetic or environmental/acquired condition; associated with another
neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder), as well as specifiers that describe
the autistic symptoms (age at first concern; wi th or without loss of established skills; sever-

individuals previously diagnosed with Asperg er’s disorder would now receive a diagnosis
of autism spectrum disorder without language or intellectual impairment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,77
"ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by impairing levels of inattention, dis-
organization, and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. Inattention and disorganization entail inabil-
ity to stay on task, seeming not to listen, and lo sing materials, at leve ls that are inconsistent
with age or developmental level.  Hyperactivity-impulsivity entails  overactivity, fidgeting, in-
ability to stay seated, intruding into other people’s activities , and inability to wait—symptoms
that are excessive for age or developmental level. In childhood, ADHD frequently overlaps
with disorders that are often considered to be “externalizing disorders,” such as oppositional
defiant disorder and conduct di sorder. ADHD often persists in to adulthood, with resultant
impairments of social, academic and occupational functioning",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,77

tor skills that cause interference with activiti es of daily living. St ereotypic movement dis-
order is diagnosed when an individual has repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently
purposeless motor behaviors, such as hand fl apping, body rocking, head banging, self-
biting, or hitting. The movements interfere with  social, academic, or other activities. If the

skills in reading, writing, and/ or math. The individual’s perfor mance of the affected academic

Diagnostic Criteria
Intellectual disability (intellectual development al disorder) is a disorder with onset during
the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits
in conceptual, social, and practical domains. The following three criteria must be met:
A. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract
thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed by
both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,78
"B. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and socio-
cultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongo-
ing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life,
such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple
environments, such as home, school, work, and community",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,78
C. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,78
"Note:  The diagnostic term intellectual disability  is the equivalent term for the ICD-11 diag-
nosis of intellectual developmental disorders.  Although the term intellectual disability  is
used throughout this manual, both terms are used in the title to clarify relationships with
other classification systems. Moreover, a federal statute in the United States (Public Law
111-256, Rosa’s Law) replaces the term mental retardation with intellectual disability,  and
research journals use the term intellectual disability. Thus, intellectual disability  is the
term in common use by medical, educational, and other professions and by the lay public

Severity 
level Conceptual domain Social domain Practical domain
Mild For preschool children, there 
may be no obvious conceptual 
differences. Fo r school-age 
children and adults, there are 
difficulties in learning aca-
demic skills involving reading, 
writing, arithmetic, time, or 
money, with support needed 
in one or more areas to meet 
age-related expectations. In 
adults, abstract thinking, exec-
utive function (i.e., planning, 
strategizing, priority setting, 
and cognitive flexibility), and 
short-term memory, as well as 
functional use of academic 
skills (e.g., reading, money 
management), are impaired. 
There is a somewhat concrete 
approach to problems and 
solutions compared with 
age-mates. Compared with typically developing age-
mates, the individual is immature in social 
interactions. For example, there may be diffi-
culty in accurately perceiving peers’ social 
cues. Communication, conversation, and lan-
guage are more concrete or immature than 
expected for age. There may be difficulties reg-
ulating emotion and behavior in age-appropri-
ate fashion; these difficulties are noticed by 
peers in social situations. There is limited 
understanding of risk in social situations; 
social judgment is immature for age, and 
the person is at risk of being manipulated 
by others (gullibility).The individual may functi on age-appropriately in 
personal care. Individuals need some support with 
complex daily living tasks in comparison to peers. In 
adulthood, supports typicall y involve grocery shop-
ping, transportation, home  and child-care organiz-
ing, nutritious food preparation, and banking and 
money management. Recreati onal skills resemble 
those of age-mates, although judgment related to 
well-being and organization around recreation 
requires support. In adulthood, competitive 
employment is often seen in  jobs that do not empha-
size conceptual skills. Individuals generally need 
support to make health care decisions and legal 
decisions, and to learn to perform a skilled vocation 
competently. Support is typically needed to raise a 
family.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,79
"Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) 35Moderate All through development, the 
individual’s conceptual skills 
lag markedly behind those of 
peers. For preschoolers, lan-
guage and pre-academic skills 
develop slowly. For school-age 
children, progress in reading, 
writing, mathematics, and 
understanding of time and 
money occurs slowly across 
the school years and is mark-
edly limited compared with 
that of peers. For adults, aca-
demic skill development is 
typically at an elementary 
level, and support is required 
for all use of academic skills in 
work and personal life. Ongo-
ing assistance on a daily basis 
is needed to complete concep-
tual tasks of day-to-day life, 
and others may take over these 
responsibilities fully for the 
individual.The individual shows marked differences from 
peers in social and communicative behavior 
across development. Spoken language is typi-
cally a primary tool for social communication 
but is much less complex than that of peers. 
Capacity for relationships is evident in ties to 
family and friends, and the individual may 
have successful friendships across life and 
sometimes romantic relations in adulthood. 
However, individuals may not perceive or 
interpret social cues ac curately. Social judg-
ment and decision-making abilities are lim-
ited, and caretakers must assist the person 
with life decisions. Friendships with typically 
developing peers are often affected by com-
munication or social limitations. Significant 
social and communicative support is needed 
in work settings for success. The individual can care for personal needs involving 
eating, dressing, elimination, and hygiene as an 
adult, although an  extended period of teaching and 
time is needed for the individual to become indepen-
dent in these areas, and reminders may be needed. 
Similarly, participation in all household tasks can be 
achieved by adulthood, although an extended 
period of teaching is ne eded, and ongoing supports 
will typically occur for adult-level performance. 
Independent employment in jobs that require lim-
ited conceptual and communication skills can be 
achieved, but considerable support from co-work-
ers, supervisors, and others is needed to manage 
social expectations, job co mplexities, and ancillary 
responsibilities such as scheduling, transportation, 
health benefits, and mone y management. A variety 
of recreational skills can be developed. These typi-
cally require additional  supports and learning 
opportunities over an ex tended period of time. 
Maladaptive behavior is present in a significant 
minority and causes  social problems.TABLE 1 Severity levels for intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) (continued)

"36 Neurodevelopmental DisordersSevere Attainment of conceptual skills 
is limited. The individual gen-
erally has little understanding 
of written language or of con-
cepts involving numbers, 
quantity, time, and money. 
Caretakers provide extensive 
supports for problem solving 
throughout life. Spoken language is quit e limited in terms of 
vocabulary and grammar. Speech may be sin-
gle words or phrases and may be supple-
mented through augmentative means. Speech 
and communication are focused on the here 
and now within everyday  events. Language is 
used for social communication more than for 
explication. Individuals understand simple 
speech and gestural communication. Relation-
ships with family members and familiar others 
are a source of pleasure and help. The individual requires suppo rt for all activities of 
daily living, including meals, dressing, bathing, and 
elimination. The individual requires supervision at 
all times. The individual cannot make responsible 
decisions regarding well-being of self or others. In 
adulthood, participation in tasks at home, recre-
ation, and work requires ongoing support and assis-
tance. Skill acquisition in all domains involves long-
term teaching and ongoing support. Maladaptive 
behavior, including self-injury, is present in a signif-
icant minority. 
Profound Conceptual skills generally 
involve the physical world 
rather than symbolic pro-
cesses. The individual may use 
objects in goal-directed fashion 
for self-care, work, and recre-
ation. Certain visuospatial 
skills, such as matching and 
sorting based on physical char-
acteristics, may be acquired. 
However, co-occ urring motor 
and sensory impairments may 
prevent functional use of 
objects. The individual has very limited understanding 
of symbolic communication in speech or ges-
ture. He or she may understand some simple 
instructions or gestures. The individual 
expresses his or her own desires and emotions 
largely through nonverbal, nonsymbolic com-
munication. The individu al enjoys relation-
ships with well-known family members, 
caretakers, and familiar others, and initiates 
and responds to social interactions through 
gestural and emotional  cues. Co-occurring 
sensory and physical impairments may pre-
vent many social activities. The individual is dependent on others for all aspects of 
daily physical care, health, and safety, although he or 
she may be able to participat e in some of these activi-
ties as well. Individuals without severe physical 
impairments may assist with some daily work tasks at 
home, like carrying dishes to the table. Simple actions 
with objects may be the basi s of participation in some 
vocational activities with high levels of ongoing sup-
port. Recreational activities  may involve, for example, 
enjoyment in listening to music, watching movies, 
going out for walks, or part icipating in water activi-
ties, all with the support of others. Co-occurring 
physical and sensory impairments are frequent 
barriers to participation (beyond watching) in home, 
recreational, and vocational activities. Maladaptive 
behavior is present in a significant minority.TABLE 1 Severity levels for intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) (continued)

"Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) 37
Diagnostic Features
The essential features of intellectual disab ility (intellectual developmental disorder) are
deficits in general mental abilities (Criteri on A) and impairment in everyday adaptive
functioning, in comparison to an individual ’s age-, gender-, and socioculturally matched
peers (Criterion B). Onset is during the developmental period  (Criterion C). The diagnosis
of intellectual disability is based on both clinical assessment and standardized testing of
intellectual and adaptive functions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,82
"Criterion A refers to intellectual function s that involve reasoning, problem solving,
planning, abstract thinking, judgment, lear ning from instruction and experience, and
practical understanding. Critical componen ts include verbal comprehension, working
memory, perceptual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract thought, and cognitive ef-
ficacy. Intellectual functioning is typically me asured with individually administered and
psychometrically valid, comprehensive, cultur ally appropriate, psychometrically sound
tests of intelligence. Individuals with intellec tual disability have scores of approximately
two standard deviations or more below the population mean, including a margin for mea-
surement error (generally +5 points). On te sts with a standard deviation of 15 and a mean
of 100, this involves a score of 65–75 (70 ± 5). Clinical training and judgment are required
to interpret test results and assess intellectual performance",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,82
"Factors that may affect test scores include practice effects and the “Flynn effect’ (i.e.,
overly high scores due to out- of-date test norms). Invalid scores may result from the use of
brief intelligence screening tests or group tests;  highly discrepant individual subtest scores
may make an overall IQ score invalid. Instrume nts must be normed for the individual’s so-
ciocultural background and native language. Co-occurring disorders that affect communi-
cation, language, and/or motor or sensory fu nction may affect test scores. Individual

"IQ test scores are approximat ions of conceptual function ing but may be insufficient to
assess reasoning in real-life situations and ma stery of practical task s. For example, a per-
son with an IQ score above 70 may have such severe adaptive behavi or problems in social

"Deficits in adaptive functioning (Criterion B) refer to how well a person meets community
standards of personal independen ce and social responsibility, in comparison to others of sim-
ilar age and sociocultural background. Adaptive  functioning involves adaptive reasoning in
three domains: conceptual, social, and practical. The conceptual (academic) domain  involves
competence in memory, language, reading, writing, math reasoning, acquisition of practical
knowledge, problem solving, and judgment  in novel situations , among others. The social do-
main  involves awareness of others’ thoughts, feelings, and experiences; empathy; interper-
sonal communication skills; friendship abilit ies; and social judgment, among others. The
practical domain involves learning and self-management across life settings, including personal
care, job responsibilities, money management, recreation, self-management of behavior, and
school and work task organization, among others . Intellectual capacity, education, motivation,
socialization, personality features, vocational opportunity, cultural experience, and coexisting
general medical conditions or mental di sorders influence adaptive functioning",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,82
"Adaptive functioning is assessed using both clinical evaluation and individualized,
culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound measures. Standardized measures are

language, and social milestones may be identifi able within the first 2 years of life among
those with more severe intellectual disability, while mild levels may not be identifiable un-
til school age when difficulty with academic learning becomes appare nt. All criteria (in-
cluding Criterion C) must be fulfilled by hi story or current presentation. Some children

"When intellectual disability is associated with  a genetic syndrome, there may be a char-
acteristic physical appearance (as in, e.g., Down syndrome). Some syndromes have a
behavioral phenotype,  which refers to specific behaviors that are characteristic of particular
genetic disorder (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan syndro me). In acquired forms, the onset may be
abrupt following an illness such as meningitis  or encephalitis or head trauma occurring
during the developmental period. When intellectual disability results from a loss of pre-

"Diagnostic Features
The core diagnostic features of language disorder are difficulties in the acquisition and use
of language due to deficits in the comprehe nsion or production of vocabulary, sentence
structure, and discourse. The language defi cits are evident in spoken communication,
written communication, or sign language. La nguage learning and use is dependent on
both receptive and expressive skills. Expressive ability refers to the production of vocal, ges-
tural, or verbal signals, while receptive ability  refers to the process of receiving and com-
prehending language messages. Language skills  need to be assessed in both expressive
and receptive modalities as these may differ in severity. For example, an individual’s ex-
pressive language may be seve rely impaired, while his recept ive language is hardly im-
paired at all",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,87
"Language disorder usually affects vocabulary and grammar, and these effects then
limit the capacity for discourse. The child’s fi rst words and phrases are likely to be delayed
in onset; vocabulary size is smaller and less varied than expected; and sentences are
shorter and less complex with grammatical errors , especially in past tense. Deficits in com-
prehension of language are fr equently underestimated, as children may be good at using
context to infer meaning. There may be word-finding problems, impoverished verbal def-
initions, or poor understand ing of synonyms, multiple meanings, or word play appro-
priate for age and culture. Problems with  remembering new words and sentences are
manifested by difficulties following instructions of increasing length, difficulties rehears-
ing strings of verbal information (e.g., remembering a phone number or a shopping list),
and difficulties remembering novel sound se quences, a skill that may be important for
learning new words. Difficulties with discour se are shown by a reduced ability to provide
adequate information abou t the key events and to narrate a coherent story",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,87
"The language difficulty is manifest by abilities substantially and quantifiably below
that expected for age and significantly inte rfering with academic achievement, occupa-
tional performance, effective communication, or  socialization (Criterion B). A diagnosis of
language disorder is made based on the synthesis of the individual’s history, direct clinical
observation in different contexts (i.e., home, school, or work), and scores from standard-
ized tests of language ability that can be  used to guide estimates of severity.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,87

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
A positive family history of language disorders is often present. Individuals, even chil-
dren, can be adept at accommodating to their limited language. They may appear to be shy
or reticent to talk. Affected individuals may prefer to communicate only with family mem-
bers or other familiar individuals. Although these social indicators are not diagnostic of a
language disorder, if they are notable and pers istent, they warrant referral for a full lan-
guage assessment. Language d isorder, particularly expressiv e deficits, may co-occur with

"Development and Course
Language acquisition is marked by changes from  onset in toddlerhood to the adult level of
competency that appears during adolescence.  Changes appear across the dimensions of
language (sounds, words, grammar, narrati ves/expository texts, and conversational
skills) in age-graded increments and synchron ies. Language disorder emerges during the
early developmental period; however, there is considerable variation in early vocabulary
acquisition and early word combinations, an d individual differenc es are not, as single
indicators, highly predictive of later outcomes. By age 4 years, individual differences in
language ability are more stable, with bette r measurement accuracy, and are highly pre-
dictive of later outcomes. Language disorder diagnosed from 4 years of age is likely to be
stable over time and typically persists into adulthood, although the particular profile of

Speech sound production descri bes the clear articulation of  the phonemes (i.e., individual
sounds) that in combination make up spoken words. Speech sound production requires both
the phonological knowledge of speech sounds and the ability to coordinate the movements of

within normal limits up to age 8 years. When multiple sounds are involved, it may be appro-
priate to target some of those sounds as part of  a plan to improve intelligibility prior to the age
at which almost all children can produce them a ccurately. Lisping (i.e., misarticulating sibi-

lective mutism may develop in children with a speech disorder because of embarassment
about their impairments, but many children with selective mutism exhibit normal speech
in “safe” settings, such as at home or with close friends.

dition and is not better explained by another mental disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,91
"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of childho od-onset fluency disorder (stu ttering) is a disturbance in
the normal fluency and time patterning of spee ch that is inappropriate for the individual’s
age. This disturbance is characterized by freq uent repetitions or prolongations of sounds
or syllables and by other types of speech dysfluencies, including broken words (e.g.,
pauses within a word), audible or silent blocki ng (i.e., filled or unfilled pauses in speech),
circumlocutions (i.e., word su bstitutions to avoid proble matic words), words produced
with an excess of physical tension, and mono syllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., “I-I-I-I
see him”). The disturbance in fluency interferes with academic or occupational achieve-
ment or with social communication. The extent  of the disturbance varies from situation to
situation and often is more severe when there is special pressure to communicate (e.g., giv-
ing a report at school, interviewing for a job) . Dysfluency is often absent during oral read-
ing, singing, or talking to inanimate objects or to pets",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,91
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Fearful anticipation of the problem may develop. The speaker may attempt to avoid dys-
fluencies by linguistic mechanisms (e.g., al tering the rate of sp eech, avoiding certain
words or sounds) or by avoiding certain speec h situations, such as telephoning or public
speaking. In addition to being features of the condition, stress and anxiety have been
shown to exacerbate dysfluency",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,91
"Childhood-onset fluency diso rder may also be accompanied by motor movements
(e.g., eye blinks, tics, tremors of the lips or face, jerking of the head, breathing movements,
fist clenching). Children with fluency disorder  show a range of language abilities, and the
relationship between fluency disorder  and language abilities is unclear",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,91
"Development and Course
Childhood-onset fluency disord er, or developmental stutteri ng, occurs by age 6 for 80%–
90% of affected individuals, with age at onset ranging from 2 to 7 years. The onset can be
insidious or more sudden. Typically, dysfluencies  start gradually, with repetition of initial
consonants, first words of a phrase, or long words. The child may not be aware of dysflu-
encies. As the disorder progresses, the dysfluencies become more frequent and interfering,
occurring on the most meaningful words or phr ases in the utterance. As the child becomes
aware of the speech difficulty, he or she may develop mechanisms for avoiding the dys-
fluencies and emotional responses, including avoidance of public speaking and use of
short and simple utterances. Longitudinal research shows that 65%–85% of children re-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,91

"Differential Diagnosis
Sensory deficits. Dysfluencies of speech may be associated with a hearing impairment
or other sensory deficit or a sp eech-motor deficit. When the speech dysfluencies are in ex-
cess of those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of childhood-onset flu-
ency disorder may be made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,92
"Normal speech dysfluencies. The disorder must be distinguished from normal dysflu-
encies that occur frequently in young children, which include whole-word or phrase rep-
etitions (e.g., “I want, I want ice cream”), incomplete phrases, in terjections, unfilled
pauses, and parenthetical remarks. If these difficulties increase in frequency or complexity
as the child grows older, a diagnosis of child hood-onset fluency diso rder is appropriate",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,92
"Medication side effects. Stuttering may occur as a side effect of medication and may be
detected by a temporal relationship with exposure to the medication",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,92
"Adult-onset dysfluencies. If onset of dysfluencies is during  or after adolescence, it is an
“adult-onset dysfluency” rather than a neurodevelopmental disorder . Adult-onset dysflu-
encies are associated with specific neurologic al insults and a variety of medical conditions
and mental disorders and may be specified with them, but they are not a DSM-5 diagnosis.

abilities in the domains of word structure and grammar, and are not better explained by
autism spectrum disorder, intellectual dis ability (intellectual developmental disorder),
global developmental delay, or another mental disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,93
"Diagnostic Features
Social (pragmatic) communication  disorder is characterized by a primary difficulty with
pragmatics, or the social use of language an d communication, as manifested by deficits in
understanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in nat-
uralistic contexts, changing language accordin g to the needs of the listener or situation,
and following rules for conversations and stor ytelling. The deficits in social communica-
tion result in functional limitations in effective communicatio n, social participation, devel-
opment of social relationships, academic ac hievement, or occupational performance. The
deficits are not better explaine d by low abilities in the domains of structural language or
cognitive ability",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,93
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
The most common associated feat ure of social (pragmatic) co mmunication disorder is lan-
guage impairment, which is characterized by a history of delay in reaching language mile-
stones, and historical, if not current, structur al language problems (see “Language Disorder”
earlier in this chapter). Individuals with social  communication deficits may avoid social inter-
actions. Attention-deficit/hype ractivity disorder (ADHD), beha vioral problems, and specific
learning disorders are also more common among affected individuals",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,93
"Development and Course 
Because social (pragmatic) co mmunication depends on adeq uate developmental progress
in speech and language, diagnosis of social (pragmatic) communication disorder is rare
among children younger than 4 years. By ag e 4 or 5 years, most  children should possess
adequate speech and language abilities to permit identification of specific deficits in social
communication. Milder forms of  the disorder may not become apparent until early ado-
lescence, when language and social interactions become more complex",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,93
"The outcome of social (pragmatic) communicat ion disorder is variable, with some chil-
dren improving substantially over time and othe rs continuing to have difficulties persist-
ing into adulthood. Even am ong those who have significant improvements, the early
deficits in pragmatics may cause lasting impa irments in social relationships and behavior
and also in acquisition of other rela ted skills, such as written expression. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. A family history of autism spectrum disorder, communica-
tion disorders, or specific learning disorder appears to increase the risk for social (prag-
matic) communication disorder.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,93
"Unspecified Communication Disorder 49
Differential Diagnosis
Autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum disorder is  the primary diagnostic con-
sideration for individuals presenting with social communication de ficits. The two disor-
ders can be differentiated by the presence in  autism spectrum disorder of restricted/
repetitive patterns of behavior , interests, or activities and their absence in social (prag-
matic) communication disorder. Individuals wi th autism spectrum disorder may only dis-
play the restricted/repetitive patterns of behavi or, interests, and activities during the early
developmental period, so a co mprehensive history should be  obtained. Current absence of
symptoms would not preclude a diagnosis of autism spectrum  disorder, if the restricted
interests and repetitive behaviors were present in the past. A diagnosis of social (prag-
matic) communication disorder should be considered only if the developmental history
fails to reveal any evidence of restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or ac-
tivities",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,94

"Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). The symptoms of social communication disor-
der overlap with those of social anxiety diso rder. The differentiating feature is the timing
of the onset of symptoms. In social (pragm atic) communication di sorder, the individual

"Diagnostic Features
The essential features of autism spectrum diso rder are persistent impairment in reciprocal
social communication and social interaction (Criterion A), and restricted, repetitive pat-
terns of behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B). These symptoms are present from
early childhood and limit or impair everyday  functioning (Criteria C and D). The stage at
which functional impairment becomes obvious will vary according to characteristics of
the individual and his or her environment. Co re diagnostic features are evident in the
developmental period, but intervention, co mpensation, and current supports may mask
difficulties in at least some contexts. Manifestations of the disorder also vary greatly de-
pending on the severity of the autistic condit ion, developmental level,  and chronological age;
hence, the term spectrum. Autism spectrum disorder enco mpasses disorders previously re-
ferred to as early infantile  autism, childhood autism, Ka nner’s autism, high-functioning
autism, atypical autism, pervasive developmen tal disorder not otherw ise specified, child-
hood disintegrative disorder , and Asperger’s disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,98
"The impairments in communicat ion and social interaction specified in Criterion A are
pervasive and sustained. Diagnoses are most  valid and reliable when based on multiple
sources of information, including clinician’s observations, caregiver history, and, when
possible, self-report. Verbal and nonverbal deficits in social communication have varying
manifestations, depending on the individual’s age, intellectual level,  and language ability,
as well as other factors such as treatment history and current support. Many individuals
have language deficits, ranging from complete lack of speech through language delays,
poor comprehension of speech, echoed speech, or stilted  and overly literal language. Even
when formal language skills (e.g ., vocabulary, grammar) are intact, the use of language for
reciprocal social communication is im paired in autism spectrum disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,98
"Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity (i.e.,  the ability to engage with others and share
thoughts and feelings) are cl early evident in young children with the disorder, who may
show little or no initiation of social interaction and no sharing of emotions, along with re-
duced or absent imitation of others’ behavior . What language exists is often one-sided,
lacking in social reciprocity, and used to re quest or label rather th an to comment, share
feelings, or converse. In adults without inte llectual disabilities or language delays, deficits
in social-emotional reciprocity may be most apparent in difficulties processing and re-
sponding to complex social cues (e.g., when  and how to join a conversation, what not to
say). Adults who have developed compensation strategies for some social challenges still
struggle in novel or un supported situations and suffer fr om the effort and anxiety of con-
sciously calculating what is social ly intuitive for most individuals.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,98
"54 Neurodevelopmental Disorders
Deficits in nonverbal communicative behavi ors used for social interaction are mani-
fested by absent, reduced, or atypical use of  eye contact (relative to cultural norms), ges-
tures, facial expressions, body  orientation, or speech intona tion. An early feature of autism
spectrum disorder is impaired joint attention as manifested by  a lack of pointing, showing,
or bringing objects to share interest with others, or failure to follow someone’s pointing or
eye gaze. Individuals may learn a few functional  gestures, but their re pertoire is smaller
than that of others, and they often fail to use expressive gestures spontaneously in com-
munication. Among adults with fluent language, the difficulty in coordinating nonverbal
communication with speech may give the impr ession of odd, wooden, or exaggerated
“body language” during interactions. Impairme nt may be relatively subtle within indi-
vidual modes (e.g., someone may have relati vely good eye contact when speaking) but
noticeable in poor integration of eye contact, gesture, body posture, prosody, and facial ex-
pression for social communication",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,99
"Deficits in developing, maintaining, an d understanding relationships should be
judged against norms for age, gender, and culture. There may be absent, reduced, or atyp-
ical social interest, manifested by rejectio n of others, passivity, or inappropriate ap-
proaches that seem aggressive or disruptive . These difficulties are particularly evident in
young children, in whom there is often a lack of shared social play and imagination (e.g.,
age-appropriate flexible pretend play) and, late r, insistence on playing by very fixed rules",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,99
"Older individuals may struggle to understand what behavior is considered appropriate in
one situation but not another (e.g., casual beha vior during a job interview), or the different
ways that language may be used to communic ate (e.g., irony, white lies). There may be an
apparent preference for solitary activities or  for interacting with much younger or older
people. Frequently, there is a de sire to establish friendships wi thout a complete or realistic
idea of what friendship entails (e.g., one-sid ed friendships or friendships based solely on
shared special interests). Relationships with siblings, co-workers, and caregivers are also
important to consider (i n terms of reciprocity)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,99
"Autism spectrum disorder is also defined by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior,
interests, or activities (as specified in Criterion B), which show a range of manifestations
according to age and ability, intervention, and current supports. Stereotyped or repetitive
behaviors include simple motor stereotypies (e.g., hand flappi ng, finger flicking), repeti-
tive use of objects (e.g., spinning coins, linin g up toys), and repetitive speech (e.g., echola-
lia, the delayed or immediate parroting of heard words; use of “you” when referring to
self; stereotyped use of words, phrases, or pr osodic patterns). Exce ssive adherence to rou-
tines and restricted patterns of behavior may be manifest in resistance to change (e.g., dis-
tress at apparently small changes, such as in packaging of a favorite food; insistence on
adherence to rules; rigidity of thinking) or ri tualized patterns of ve rbal or nonverbal be-
havior (e.g., repetitive questioning, pacing a perimeter). Highly restricted, fixated interests
in autism spectrum disorder tend to be ab normal in intensity or  focus (e.g., a toddler
strongly attached to a pan; a child preoccupied with vacuum cleaners; an adult spending
hours writing out timetables). Some fascinations and routines may relate to apparent hy-
per- or hyporeactivity to sensory input, ma nifested through extreme responses to specific
sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touc hing of objects, fascination with lights or
spinning objects, and sometimes apparent indi fference to pain, heat, or cold. Extreme re-

"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder also have intellectual impairment and/or
language impairment (e.g., slow  to talk, language comprehension behind production). Even
those with average or high inte lligence have an uneven profil e of abilities. The gap between
intellectual and adaptive function al skills is often large. Moto r deficits are often present, in-
cluding odd gait, clumsiness, and other abnormal  motor signs (e.g., walk ing on tiptoes). Self-
injury (e.g., head banging, biting the wris t) may occur, and disr uptive/challenging behav-
iors are more common in children and adoles cents with autism spectrum disorder than
other disorders, including intellectual disabili ty. Adolescents and adults with autism spec-
trum disorder are prone to anxiety and depres sion. Some individuals develop catatonic-like
motor behavior (slowing and “f reezing” mid-action), but thes e are typically not of the mag-
nitude of a catatonic episode. However, it is possible for individuals with autism spectrum
disorder to experience a marked deterioratio n in motor symptoms an d display a full cata-
tonic episode with symptoms such as mutism, posturing, grimacing and waxy flexibility",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,100

"Prevalence 
In recent years, reported frequencies for au tism spectrum disorder  across U.S. and non-
U.S. countries have approached 1% of the po pulation, with similar estimates in child and
adult samples. It remains unclear whether high er rates reflect an expansion of the diag-
nostic criteria of DSM-IV to include subthreshold cases, increased awareness, differences
in study methodology, or a true increase in  the frequency of autism spectrum disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,100
"Development and Course
The age and pattern of onset also should be noted for autism spectr um disorder. Symptoms
are typically recognized during th e second year of life (12–24 months of age) but may be seen
earlier than 12 months if developmental delays  are severe, or noted later than 24 months if
symptoms are more subtle. The pattern of onset description might include information
about early developmental delays or any losses of social or language skills. In cases where
skills have been lost, parents or caregivers may give a history of a gradual or relatively
rapid deterioration in social behaviors or lang uage skills. Typically, this would occur be-
tween 12 and 24 months of age and is distinguished from the rare instances of developmen-
tal regression occurring after at least 2 years of normal development (previously described
as childhood disintegrative disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,100
"The behavioral features of autism spectrum  disorder first become evident in early
childhood, with some cases presenting a lack of  interest in social interaction in the first
year of life. Some children with autism spectrum disorder experience developmental pla-
teaus or regression, with a gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors or
use of language, often du ring the first 2 years of life. Such losses are rare in other disor-
ders and may be a useful “red flag” for autism spectrum disorder. Much more unusual
and warranting more extensive medical invest igation are losses of skills beyond social
communication (e.g., loss of se lf-care, toileting, motor skills) or those occurring after the",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,100

disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,101
"First symptoms of autism spectrum disorder frequently involve delayed language de-
velopment, often accompanied by lack of social interest or unusual social interactions (e.g.,
pulling individuals by the hand without any a ttempt to look at them ), odd play patterns
(e.g., carrying toys around but never pl aying with them), and unusual communication
patterns (e.g., knowing the alphabet but not responding to own name). Deafness may be
suspected but is typically ruled out. During the second year, odd and repetitive behaviors
and the absence of typical play become more apparent. Since many typically developing
young children have strong preferences and en joy repetition (e.g., eating the same foods,
watching the same vide o multiple times), dist inguishing restricted and repetitive behav-
iors that are diagnostic of autism spectrum disorder can be difficult in preschoolers. The

reported difficulties. Where clinical observat ion suggests criteria are currently met, autism
spectrum disorder may be diagno sed, provided there is no evidence of good social and com-
munication skills in childhood. For example, the re port (by parents or another relative) that the
individual had ordinary and sustained recipr ocal friendships and good nonverbal communi-

"Risk and Prognostic Factors
The best established prognostic factors for individual outcome wi thin autism spectrum
disorder are presence or absence of associa ted intellectual disability and language impair-

mental health problems. Epilepsy, as a comorb id diagnosis, is associated with greater in-
tellectual disability and lower verbal ability",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,101

"Autism Spectrum Disorder 57
Genetic and physiological. Heritability estimates for au tism spectrum disorder have
ranged from 37% to higher than 90%, based on  twin concordance rates. Currently, as many
as 15% of cases of autism spec trum disorder appear  to be associated with a known genetic
mutation, with different  de novo copy number variants or de novo mutations in specific
genes associated with the disorder in differ ent families. However, even when an autism
spectrum disorder is associated with a know n genetic mutation, it does not appear to be
fully penetrant. Risk for the remainder of case s appears to be polygenic, with perhaps hun-

"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
Cultural differences will exist in norms for social interaction, no nverbal communication,
and relationships, but individuals with auti sm spectrum disorder are markedly impaired
against the norms for their cultural context. Cultural and socioeconomic factors may affect
age at recognition or diagnosis; for example, in the United Stat es, late or underdiagnosis of
autism spectrum disorder among Af rican American children may occur",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,102
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Autism spectrum disorder is di agnosed four times more often in males than in females. In
clinic samples, females tend to be more li kely to show accompanying intellectual disabil-

munication difficulties",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,102
"Functional Consequences of  Autism Spectrum Disorder
In young children with autism spectrum diso rder, lack of social and communication abil-
ities may hamper learning, especially learning through social interaction or in settings
with peers. In the home, insistence on rout ines and aversion to change, as well as sensory
sensitivities, may interfere with eating and sleeping and make routine care (e.g., haircuts,
dental work) extremely difficult. Adaptive skills are typically below measured IQ. Ex-
treme difficulties in planning, organization , and coping with change negatively impact
academic achievement, even fo r students with above-average intelligence. During adult-
hood, these indivi duals may have difficulties establishing independence because of con-
tinued rigidity and difficulty with novelty",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,102
"Many individuals with autism spectrum d isorder, even without intellectual disability,
have poor adult psychosocial functioning as indexed by measures such as independent
living and gainful employment. Functional cons equences in old age are unknown, but so-

consequences for health in older adulthood",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,102

disability is appropriate when social communi cation and interaction are significantly im-
paired relative to the developmental level of the individual’s nonverbal skills (e.g., fine

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of attent ion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent
pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or
development. Inattention  manifests behaviorally in ADHD as wandering off task, lacking
persistence, having difficulty sustaining focus, and being disorganized and is not due to
defiance or lack of comprehension. Hyperactivity  refers to excessive motor activity (such as
a child running about) when it is not appropriat e, or excessive fidgeting, tapping, or talk-
ativeness. In adults, hyperactivity may manife st as extreme restlessness or wearing others
out with their activity. Impulsivity  refers to hasty actions that  occur in the moment without
forethought and that have high potential for harm to the individual (e.g., darting into the
street without looking). Impulsivity may reflec t a desire for immediate rewards or an in-
ability to delay gratification.  Impulsive behaviors may manifest as social intrusiveness
(e.g., interrupting others excessively) and/ or as making important decisions without con-
sideration of long-term consequences (e.g., taking a job without ad equate information)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,106
"ADHD begins in childhood. The requirement that several symptoms  be present before
age 12 years conveys the importance of a substantial clinical presentation during child-
hood. At the same time, an earlier age at onset is not specified because of difficulties in es-
tablishing precise childhood onset retrospectively. Adult recall of childhood symptoms
tends to be unreliable, and it is bene ficial to obtain ancillary information",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,106
"Manifestations of the disorder must be presen t in more than one setting (e.g., home and
school, work). Confirmation of substantial symptoms across settings typically cannot be
done accurately without consulting informants who have seen the individual in those set-
tings. Typically, symptoms vary depending on context within a given setting. Signs of the
disorder may be minimal or absent when the individual is receiving frequent rewards for
appropriate behavior, is under close supervision,  is in a novel setting, is engaged in espe-
cially interesting activities, has consistent exte rnal stimulation (e.g., via electronic screens),
or is interacting in one-on-one situa tions (e.g., the clinician's office)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,106

"Even in the absence of a specific learning disorder, academic or work performance is often im-

dividuals with ADHD may exhibit cognitive pr oblems on tests of attention, executive
function, or memory, although these tests are not suff iciently sensitive or specific to serve as di-

Development and Course
Many parents first observe excessive motor activity when the child is a toddler, but symp-
toms are difficult to distinguish from highly  variable normative be haviors before age 4
years. ADHD is most often identified during elementary school years, and inattention be-
comes more prominent and impairing. The disord er is relatively stable through early ad-
olescence, but some individuals have a worsened course wi th development of antisocial
behaviors. In most individuals with ADHD , symptoms of motoric hyperactivity become
less obvious in adolescence and adulthood, bu t difficulties with restlessness, inattention,
poor planning, and impulsivity persist. A subs tantial proportion of children with ADHD
remain relatively impa ired into adulthood",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,107
"In preschool, the main manifestation is hyperactivity. Inattentio n becomes more prom-
inent during elementary school. During adoles cence, signs of hypera ctivity (e.g., running

"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. ADHD is associated with reduced be havioral inhibition, effortful con-

"Environmental. Very low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams) conveys a two- to three-
fold risk for ADHD, but most children with low birth weig ht do not develop ADHD. Al-
though ADHD is correlated with smoking du ring pregnancy, some of this association
reflects common genetic risk. A minority of c ases may be related to reactions to aspects of
diet. There may be a history of child abuse, neglect, multiple  foster placements, neurotoxin
exposure (e.g., lead), infectio ns (e.g., encephalitis), or alcohol exposure in utero. Exposure
to environmental toxicants has been correlat ed with subsequent ADHD, but it is not
known whether these associations are causal",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,107

marked co-occurring clumsiness and motor delays should be coded separately [e.g., de-

with ADHD are significantly more likely than  their peers without ADHD to develop con-
duct disorder in adolescence and antisocial  personality disorder in adulthood, conse-
quently increasing the likelihood for substance use disorders and incarceration. The risk of
subsequent substance use disorders is elevated, especially when conduct disorder or an-

Specific learning disorder is a neurodevelopmental  disorder with a biological origin that is
the basis for abnormalities at a cognitive level that are associated with the behavioral signs
of the disorder. The biological origin includes an interaction of geneti c, epigenetic, and en-
vironmental factors, which affect the brain’s ab ility to perceive or process verbal or non-
verbal information efficiently and accurately",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,113
"One essential feature of specific learning diso rder is persistent diff iculties learning key-
stone academic skills (Criterion A), with onset duri ng the years of formal schooling (i.e., the de-
velopmental period). Key academic skills incl ude reading of single words accurately and
fluently, reading comprehension,  written expression and spelling, arithmetic calculation, and
mathematical reasoning (solving mathematical problems). In contrast to talking or walking,
which are acquired developmenta l milestones that emerge wi th brain maturation, academic
skills (e.g., reading, spelling, writing, mathematic s) have to be taught and learned explicitly",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,113
"Specific learning disorder disrupts the normal pa ttern of learning academ ic skills; it is not sim-
ply a consequence of lack of o pportunity of learning or inadeq uate instruction. Difficulties
mastering these key academic skills may also impe de learning in other academic subjects (e.g.,
history, science, social studies) , but those problems are attributable to difficulties learning the
underlying academic skills. Difficulties learning  to map letters with the sounds of one’s lan-
guage—to read printed words (often called dyslexia)—is one of the most common manifesta-
tions of specific learning disord er. The learning difficulties manifest as a range of observable,
descriptive behaviors or symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1–A6). These clinical symptoms may
be observed, probed by means of the clinical interview, or ascert ained from school reports, rat-
ing scales, or descriptions in previous educational or psychological assessments. The learning
difficulties are persistent, not transitory. In ch ildren and adolescents, persistence  is defined as
restricted progress in learning (i.e., no evidence that the individual is catching up with class-
mates) for at least 6 months despite the provision of extra help at home or school. For example,
difficulties learning to read si ngle words that do not fully or rapidly remit with the provision of
instruction in phonological skills or word iden tification strategies may indicate a specific",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,113

learning disorder. Evidence of persistent learning difficulties  may be derived from cumulative
school reports, portfolios of the child’s evalua ted work, curriculum-based measures, or clinical
interview. In adults, persistent difficulty refers  to ongoing difficulties in literacy or numeracy
skills that manifest during childhood or adol escence, as indicated by cumulative evidence
from school reports, evaluated portfo lios of work, or previous assessments",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,114
"A second key feature is that the individual’s performance of the affected academic skills is
well below average for age (Criterion B). One robust clinical indicator of difficulties learning
academic skills is low academic achievement for age or average achievement that is sustain-
able only by extraordinarily high levels of effort  or support. In children, the low academic skills
cause significant interference in school performance (as indicated by school reports and
teacher’s grades or ratings). Another clinical indicator, particularly in adults, is avoidance of
activities that require the academic skills. Also in adulthood, low academic  skills interfere with
occupational performance or everyday activities  requiring those skills (as indicated by self-re-
port or report by others). However, this criterion also requires psycho metric evidence from an
individually administered, psychometrically s ound and culturally appropriate test of aca-
demic achievement that is norm -referenced or criter ion-referenced. Academic skills are dis-
tributed along a continuum, so there is no natural cutpoint that can be used to differentiate
individuals with and without spec ific learning disorder. Thus, any threshold used to specify
what constitutes significantly low academic achi evement (e.g., academic skills well below age
expectation) is to a large extent arbitrary. Lo w achievement scores on one or more standard-
ized tests or subtests within an academic domain (i.e., at least 1.5 standard deviations [SD] be-
low the population mean for age, which translates to a standard score of 78 or less, which is
below the 7th percentile) are need ed for the greatest diagnostic certainty. However, precise
scores will vary according to the particular standardized tests that are used. On the basis of
clinical judgment, a more leni ent threshold may be used (e.g., 1.0–2.5 SD below the pop-
ulation mean for age), when learning diffic ulties are supported by  converging evidence
from clinical assessment, academic history, school reports, or test  scores. Moreover, since
standardized tests are not available in all languages, the diagnosis may then be based in
part on clinical judgment of sc ores on available test measures",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,114
"A third core feature is that the learning di fficulties are readily apparent in the early
school years in most individuals (Criterion C) . However, in others, the learning difficulties
may not manifest fully until later school year s, by which time learning demands have in-
creased and exceed the individual’s limited capacities",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,114
"Another key diagnostic feature is that the learning difficulties  are considered “spe-
cific,” for four reasons. First, they are not attr ibutable to intellectual disabilities (intellec-
tual disability [intellectual developmenta l disorder]); global developmental delay;
hearing or vision disorders, or neurological or motor disorders) (Criterion D). Specific
learning disorder affects lear ning in individuals who othe rwise demonstrate normal lev-
els of intellectual functioning (generally estima ted by an IQ score of greater than about 70
[±5 points allowing for measurement error ]). The phrase “unexpected academic under-
achievement” is often cited as the defining ch aracteristic of specific learning disorder in
that the specific learning disabilities are not part of a more general learning difficulty as
manifested in intellectual disability or global developmental delay. Specific learning dis-
order may also occur in individuals identified  as intellectually “gifted.” These individuals
may be able to sustain apparently adequate  academic functioning by using compensatory
strategies, extraordinarily high effort, or su pport, until the learning demands or assess-
ment procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose barri ers to their demonstrating their learning or
accomplishing required tasks. Second, the lear ning difficulty cannot be  attributed to more
general external factors, such as economic or environmental disadvantage, chronic absen-
teeism, or lack of education as typically prov ided in the individual’s community context",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,114
"Third, the learning difficulty canno t be attributed to a neurol ogical (e.g., pediatric stroke)
or motor disorders or to vision or hearing di sorders, which are often associated with prob-
lems learning academic skills but are distinguishable by presence of neurological signs.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,114

Finally, the learning difficulty may be restricted to one academic skill or domain (e.g., read-
ing single words, retrieving or  calculating number facts)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,115
"Comprehensive assessment is required. Specifi c learning disorder can only be diagnosed
after formal education starts bu t can be diagnosed at any point afterward in children, adoles-
cents, or adults, providing there is evidence of onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e.,
the developmental period). No sing le data source is sufficient fo r a diagnosis of specific learn-
ing disorder. Rather, specific learning disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on a synthesis of
the individual’s medical, develo pmental, educational, and family  history; the history of the
learning difficulty, including it s previous and current manifestat ion; the impact of the diffi-
culty on academic, occupational, or social functioning; previo us or current school reports;
portfolios of work requiring academic skills; curriculum-based assessments; and previous or
current scores from individual standardized test s of academic achievemen t. If an intellectual,

"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Specific learning disorder is frequently but not invariably preceded, in preschool years, by
delays in attention, language, or motor skills that may pers ist and co-occur with specific
learning disorder. An uneven profile of abilities is common , such as above-average abili-
ties in drawing, design, and other visuospatial  abilities, but slow, effortful, and inaccurate
reading and poor reading comprehension and written expression. Individuals with spe-
cific learning disorder typica lly (but not invariably) exhibit poor performance on psycho-
logical tests of cognitive processing. However,  it remains unclear whether these cognitive
abnormalities are the caus e, correlate, or consequence of th e learning difficulties. Also, al-
though cognitive deficits associated with diff iculties learning to read words are well doc-
umented, those associated with other manifestations of specific learning disorder (e.g.,
reading comprehension, arithmetic computat ion, written expression) are underspecified
or unknown. Moreover, individu als with similar behavioral sy mptoms or test scores are
found to have a variety of cognitive deficits, and many of these processing deficits are also
found in other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-
der [ADHD], autistic spectrum  disorder, communication diso rders, developmental coor-
dination disorder). Thus, asses sment of cognitive processing deficits is not required for
diagnostic assessment. Specific le arning disorder is associated  with increased risk for sui-
cidal ideation and suicide attempts in  children, adolescents, and adults",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,115
"There are no known biological markers of spec ific learning disorder. As a group, indi-
viduals with the disorder show circumscribe d alterations in cognitive processing and
brain structure and func tion. Genetic differences are also evident at the group level. But
cognitive testing, neuroimaging, or genetic test ing are not useful for diagnosis at this time",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,115

mathematics. However, precursors such as la nguage delays or defi cits, difficulties in
rhyming or counting, or difficulties with fine motor skills required  for writing commonly
occur in early childhood before the start of formal schooling. Manifestations may be be-
havioral (e.g., a reluctance to engage in le arning; oppositional beha vior). Specific learning
disorder is lifelong, but the course and clinical expression are variable, in part depending
on the interactions among the task demands of  the environment, the range and severity of
the individual’s learning difficulties, the indi vidual’s learning abilities, comorbidity, and
the available support systems and intervention . Nonetheless, problems with reading flu-

have trouble learning to count. Kindergarten-age children with specific learning disorder may
be unable to recognize and write letters, may be unable to write their own names, or may use
invented spelling. They may have trouble brea king down spoken words into syllables (e.g.,
“cowboy” into “cow” and “boy”) and trouble reco gnizing words that rhyme (e.g., cat, bat, hat)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,116

written number represents. Children in prim ary grades (grades 1–3) may continue to have
problems recognizing and manipulating phon emes, be unable to read common one-sylla-
ble words (such as mat or top), and be un able recognize common irregularly spelled
words (e.g., said, two). They may commit read ing errors that indicate problems in con-
necting sounds and letters (e.g., “big” for “g ot”) and have difficult y sequencing numbers
and letters. Children in grades 1-3 also may have difficulty remembering number facts or
arithmetic procedures for addi ng, subtracting, and so forth, and may complain that read-
ing or arithmetic is hard and avoid doing it. Ch ildren with specific learning disorder in the
middle grades (grades 4–6) may mispronounce or skip parts of long, multisyllable words
(e.g., say “conible” for “convertible,” “aminal” for “animal”) and confuse words that
sound alike (e.g., “tornado” for “volcano”) . They may have trouble remembering dates,
names, and telephone numbers and may have trouble completing homework or tests on

particularly when affecting reading, mathemat ics, and spelling. The relative risk of spe-
cific learning disorder in reading or mathematics is substantially higher (e.g., 4–8 times
and 5–10 times higher, respectively) in first- degree relatives of individuals with these
learning difficulties compared with those wi thout them. Family hist ory of reading diffi-

"There is high heritability for both reading ab ility and reading disability in alphabetic and
nonalphabetic languages, including high heritabi lity for most manifestations of learning abil-
ities and disabilities (e.g., heritability estimate  values greater than 0. 6). Covariation between
various manifestations of learning difficulties is high, suggesting that genes related to one

slow but accurate reading. In English-language learners, assessment should include con-
sideration of whether the source of reading difficulties is a limited proficiency with Eng-
lish or a specific learning disorder. Risk fact ors for specific learning  disorder in English-
language learners include a family history of specific learning disorder or language delay
in the native language, as well as learning difficulties in English and failure to catch up
with peers. If there is suspicio n of cultural or language differences (e.g., as in an English-
language learner), the assessment needs to ta ke into account the individual’s language
proficiency in his or her first or native lang uage as well as in the second language (in this
example, English). Also, assessment should co nsider the linguistic and cultural context in

Specific learning disorder can have negative functional consequences across the lifespan,
including lower academic attainment, higher ra tes of high school dropout, lower rates of
postsecondary education, high levels of psyc hological distress and poorer overall mental
health, higher rates of unemployment and under-employment, and lower incomes. School
dropout and co-occurring depressive symptoms increase the risk for poor mental health
outcomes, including suicidality, whereas high levels of social or emotional support predict
better mental health outcomes",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,118
"Differential Diagnosis
Normal variations in academic attainment. Specific learning disorder is distinguished
from normal variations in academic attainment due to external factors (e.g., lack of edu-

"Intellectual disability (intelle ctual developmental disorder). Specific learning disorder
differs from general learning difficulties assoc iated with intellectual  disability, because the
learning difficulties occur in the presence of normal levels of intellectual functioning (i.e.,

The essential feature of stereotypic movement disorder is repetitive, seemingly driven,
and apparently purposeless motor behavior (Criterion A). These behaviors are often
rhythmical movements of the head, hands, or body without obvious adaptive function",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,123
"The movements may or may not respond to efforts to stop them. Among typically devel-
oping children, the repetitive movements may be stopped when attention is directed to
them or when the child is distracted from performing them. Among children with neuro-
developmental disorders, the behaviors are typically less responsive to such efforts. In
other cases, the individual demonstrates self-restraining beha viors (e.g., sitting on hands,
wrapping arms in clothing, finding a protective device)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,123
"The repertoire of behaviors is variable; each individual presents with his or her own in-
dividually patterned, “signat ure” behavior. Examples of no n-self-injurious stereotypic
movements include, but are not limited to, bo dy rocking, bilateral flapping or rotating
hand movements, flicking or fl uttering fingers in front of the face, arm waving or flapping,
and head nodding. Stereotyped self-injurious behaviors include,  but are not limited to, re-
petitive head banging, face slapping, eye poki ng, and biting of hands, lips, or other body
parts. Eye poking is particularly concerning; it occurs more freq uently among children
with visual impairment. Multiple movements may be combined (e.g., cocking the head,
rocking the torso, waving a small string  repetitively in front of the face)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,123
"Stereotypic movements may oc cur many times during a da y, lasting a few seconds to
several minutes or longer. Frequency can vary  from many occurrences in a single day to
several weeks elapsing between episodes. The behaviors vary in context, occurring when
the individual is engrossed in other activities , when excited, stressed, fatigued, or bored",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,123
"Criterion A requires that the movements be  “apparently” purposeless. However, some
functions may be served by the movements. For example, stereotypic movements might
reduce anxiety in response to external stressors",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,123
"Criterion B states that the stereotypic mo vements interfere with social, academic, or
other activities and, in some children, may resu lt in self-injury (or would if protective mea-
sures were not used). If self-injury is present,  it should be coded using the specifier. Onset",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,123

of stereotypic movements is in the early deve lopmental period (Criterion C). Criterion D
states that the repetitive, stereotyped behavior  in stereotypic movement disorder is not at-
tributable to the physiological effects of a su bstance or neurological  condition and is not
better explained by another ne urodevelopmental or mental disorder. The presence of
stereotypic movements may indicate an unde tected neurodevelopmental problem, espe-
cially in children ages 1–3 years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,124
"Prevalence 
Simple stereotypic movements (e.g., rocking) ar e common in young typically developing chil-
dren. Complex stereoty pic movements are much less common (occurring in approximately
3%–4%). Between 4% and 16% of individuals with intellectual disability (intellectual develop-
mental disorder) engage in stereotypy and self-injury. The risk is greater in individuals with
severe intellectual disability. Among individual s with intellectual disability living in res-
idential facilities, 10%–15% may have stereo typic movement disord er with self-injury",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,124
"Development and Course 
Stereotypic movements typically begin within the first 3 years of life. Simple stereotypic move-
ments are common in infancy and may be involve d in acquisition of motor mastery. In chil-
dren who develop complex motor stereotypies, approximately 80% exhibit symptoms before
24 months of age, 12% between 24  and 35 months, and 8% at 36 months or older. In most typ-
ically developing children, these movements resolve over time or can be suppressed. Onset of
complex motor stereotypies may be in infancy or later in the develo pmental period. Among
individuals with intellectual disability, the ster eotyped, self-injurious behaviors may persist
for years, even though the typography or pattern of self-injury may change",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,124
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Environmental. Social isolation is a risk factor for self-stimulation that may progress to
stereotypic movements with repetitive self-inj ury. Environmental stress may also trigger
stereotypic behavior. Fear may alter physiological state, resulting in increased frequency
of stereotypic behaviors",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,124
"Genetic and physiological. Lower cognitive functioning is link ed to greater risk for stereo-
typic behaviors and poorer response to interv entions. Stereotypic movements are more fre-
quent among individuals with moderate-to-se vere/profound intellectual disability, who by
virtue of a particular syndrome (e.g., Rett syndrome) or environmental factor (e.g., an environ-
ment with relatively insufficient stimulation) se em to be at higher risk for stereotypies. Repet-
itive self-injurious behavior ma y be a behavioral phenotype in  neurogenetic syndromes. For
example, in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, there are bo th stereotypic dystonic  movements and self-
mutilation of fingers, lip biti ng, and other forms of self-injury unless the individual is re-
strained, and in Rett syndrome and Cornelia de  Lange syndrome, self-i njury may result from
the hand-to-mouth st ereotypies. Stereotypic behaviors may result from a painful medical con-
dition (e.g., middle ear infection, de ntal problems, gastro esophageal reflux)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,124

ally resolves with age. Complex stereotypi es are less common in typically developing
children and can usually be suppressed by dist raction or sensory stimulation. The indi-
vidual’s daily routine is rarely affected, and the movements generally do not cause the
child distress. The diagno sis would not be appropriat e in these circumstances",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,125
"Autism spectrum disorder. Stereotypic movements may be a presenting symptom of
autism spectrum disorder and should be con sidered when repetitive movements and be-
haviors are being evaluated. Deficits of soci al communication and re ciprocity manifesting
in autism spectrum disorder are generally ab sent in stereotypic mo vement disorder, and
thus social interaction, social communication , and rigid repetitive behaviors and interests
are distinguishing features. Wh en autism spectrum disorder is present, stereotypic move-
ment disorder is diagnosed only when there is self-injury or when the stereotypic behav-
iors are sufficiently severe to  become a focus of treatment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,125
"Tic disorders. Typically, stereotypies have an earlier age at onset (before 3 years) than
do tics, which have a mean age at onset of 5–7 years. They are consistent and fixed in their
pattern or topography compared with tics, which are variable in their presentation. Ste-
reotypies may involve arms, hands, or the entire body, while tics commonly involve eyes,
face, head, and shoulders. Stereotypies are more fixed, rhythmic, and prolonged in dura-
tion than tics, which, generally, are brief, ra pid, random, and fluctuating. Tics and stereo-
typic movements are both reduced by distraction",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,125
"Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Stereotypic movement disorder is dis-
tinguished from obsessive-co mpulsive disorder (OCD) by the absence of obsessions, as
well as by the nature of the repetitive behaviors. In OCD the individual feels driven to per-
form repetitive behaviors in response to an ob session or according to rules that must be ap-
plied rigidly, whereas in stereotypic movement disorder the behaviors are seemingly
driven but apparently purposeless. Trichot illomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoria-
tion (skin-picking) disorder are characterize d by body-focused repetitive behaviors (i.e.,
hair pulling and skin picking) that may be seemingly driven but th at are not apparently
purposeless, and that may not be patterned or rhythmical. Furthermore, onset in tricho-
tillomania and excoriation disord er is not typically in the early developmental period, but
rather around puberty or later",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,125
"Other neurological and medical conditions. The diagnosis of stereotypic movements
requires the exclusion of habits, mannerisms, pa roxysmal dyskinesias, and benign he-
reditary chorea. A neurological history and examination are required to assess features
suggestive of other disorders, such as myoclo nus, dystonia, tics, and chorea. Involuntary
movements associated with a neurological co ndition may be distinguished by their signs
and symptoms. For example, repetitive, stereotypic movements in tardive dyskinesia can
be distinguished by a history of chronic neuroleptic use and characteristic oral or facial
dyskinesia or irregular trunk or limb movements. These type s of movements do not result
in self-injury. A diagnosis of stereotypic mo vement disorder is not appropriate for repet-
itive skin picking or scratching associated with amphetamine intoxi cation or abuse (e.g.,
patients are diagnosed with substance/medication-induced obsessi ve-compulsive and re-
lated disorder) and repetitive choreoathetoid  movements associated with other neurolog-
ical disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,125

tics (Criterion A), dura tion of tic symptoms (C riterion B), age at onse t (Criterion C), and ab-
sence of any known cause such as another medical condition or substance use (Criterion D)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,126

hierarchy is diagnosed, a lower hierarchy diagnosis cannot be made (Criterion E)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,127
"Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations. An
individual may have various tic symptoms over  time, but at any point in time, the tic rep-
ertoire recurs in a characteristic fashion. Although tics can include almost any muscle group
or vocalization, certain tic symptoms, such as  eye blinking or throat clearing, are common
across patient populations. Tics are generall y experienced as involun tary but can be vol-
untarily suppressed for varying lengths of time",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,127
"Tics can be either simple or complex. Simple motor tics  are of short duration (i.e., milli-
seconds) and can include eye blinking, should er shrugging, and extension of the extrem-
ities. Simple vocal tics include throat clea ring, sniffing, and grunting often caused by
contraction of the diaphragm or  muscles of the oropharynx. Complex motor tics  are of lon-
ger duration (i.e., seconds) and often include a combination of simple tics such as simul-
taneous head turning and shoulder shrugging . Complex tics can appear purposeful, such
as a tic-like sexual or obscene gesture ( copropraxia ) or a tic-like imitation of someone else’s
movements ( echopraxia). Similarly, complex vocal tics include repeating one’s own sounds
or words ( palilalia ), repeating the last-heard word or phrase ( echolalia ), or uttering socially
unacceptable words, including obscenities,  or ethnic, racial, or religious slurs ( coprolalia )",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,127
"Importantly, coprolalia is an abrupt, sharp ba rk or grunt utterance and lacks the prosody
of similar inappropriate speech observed in human interactions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,127
"The presence of motor and/or vocal tics varies across the four tic disorders (Criterion
A). For Tourette’s disorder, both motor and vo cal tics must be present, whereas for per-
sistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder, on ly motor or only vocal tics are present. For
provisional tic disorder, motor and/or vocal tics may be presen t. For other specified or un-
specified tic disorders, the movement disorder symptoms are best characterized as tics but
are atypical in presentation or age at onset, or have a known etiology",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,127
"The 1-year minimum duration criterion (Cri terion B) assures that individuals diag-
nosed with either Tourette’s disorder or pe rsistent (chronic) moto r or vocal tic disorder
have had persistent symptoms. Tics wax and wa ne in severity, and some individuals may
have tic-free periods of weeks to months; ho wever, an individual who has had tic symp-
toms of greater than 1 year’s duration since fi rst tic onset would be considered to have per-
sistent symptoms regardless of duration of ti c-free periods. For an individual with motor
and/or vocal tics of less than 1 year since firs t tic onset, a provisional tic disorder diagnosis
can be considered. There is no duration specif ication for other specif ied and unspecified tic
disorders. The onset of tics mu st occur prior to age 18 year s (Criterion C). Tic disorders
typically begin in the prepubertal period, with  an average age at onset between 4 and 6
years, and with the incidence of new-onset tic disorders decreasing in the teen years. New
onset of tic symptoms in adulthood is exceedin gly rare and is often associated with expo-
sures to drugs (e.g., excessive cocaine use) or is a result of a central nervous system insult
(e.g., postviral encephalitis). Although tic onse t is uncommon in teenagers and adults, it is
not uncommon for adolescents an d adults to present for an initial diagnostic assessment
and, when carefully evaluated, provide a histor y of milder symptoms dating back to child-
hood. New-onset abnormal move ments suggestive of tics out side of the us ual age range

Prevalence
Tics are common in childhood but transient in most cases. The estimated prevalence of
Tourette’s disorder ranges from 3 to 8 per 1,000 in school-age children. Males are more
commonly affected than females, with the rati o varying from 2:1 to 4:1. A national survey
in the United States estimated 3 per 1,000 for the prevalence of clinically identified cases",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,128
"The frequency of identified cases was lower among African Americans and Hispanic
Americans, which may be related to differences in access to care",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,128
"Development and Course
Onset of tics is typically between ages 4 and 6 years. Peak severity occurs between ages 10
and 12 years, with a decline in severity during  adolescence. Many adults with tic disorders
experience diminished sympto ms. A small percentage of in dividuals will have persis-
tently severe or worsening symptoms in adulthood",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,128
"Tic symptoms manifest similarly in all age groups and across the lifespan. Tics wax and
wane in severity and change in affected muscle groups an d vocalizations over time. As
children get older, they begin to report th eir tics being associated with a premonitory
urge—a somatic sensation that precedes the tic—and a feeling of tension reduction follow-
ing the expression of the tic. Tics associated with a premonitory urge may be experienced
as not completely “involuntary” in that the ur ge and the tic can be resisted. An individual
may also feel the need to perform a tic in a specific way or repeat it until he or she achieves
the feeling that the tic has been done “just right.”
The vulnerability toward developing co-occurring conditions changes as individuals
pass through the age of risk for various co-o ccurring conditions. For example, prepubertal
children with tic disorders are more likely to experience attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), obsessive-co mpulsive disorder (OCD), and separation anxiety disorder
than are teenagers and adults, who are more li kely to experience the new onset of major
depressive disorder, substance use disorder, or bipolar disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,128
"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Tics are worsened by anxiety, excitement, and exhaustion and are better
during calm, focused activities. Individuals ma y have fewer tics when engaged in schoolwork
or tasks at work than when relaxing at home after school or in the evening. Stressful/exciting
events (e.g., taking a test, participating in exciting activities) often make tics worse. 
Environmental. Observing a gesture or sound in another person may result in an indi-
vidual with a tic disorder making a simila r gesture or sound, which may be incorrectly
perceived by others as purposeful. This can be a particular problem when the individual is
interacting with authority figures (e .g., teachers, supe rvisors, police)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,128

sociated with worse tic severity",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,128

"Functional Consequenc es of Tic Disorders
Many individuals with mild to moderate tic se verity experience no distress or impairment
in functioning and may even be unaware of their tics. Individuals with more severe symp-
toms generally have more impairment in daily living, but ev en individuals with moderate
or even severe tic disorders may function we ll. The presence of a co-occurring condition,
such as ADHD or OCD, can have greater impa ct on functioning. Less commonly, tics dis-
rupt functioning in daily activities and result in social isolation, interpersonal conflict,
peer victimization, inab ility to work or to go to school, and lower quality of life. The indi-
vidual also may experience substantial psycho logical distress. Rare complications of Tou-
rette’s disorder include physical injury, such as  eye injury (from hitting oneself in the face),
and orthopedic and neurological injury (e.g., disc disease related to forceful head and neck
movements)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,129
"Differential Diagnosis
Abnormal movements that may accompany other medical conditions and stereotypic
movement disorder. Motor stereotypies  are defined as involuntary rhythmic, repetitive,
predictable movements that appe ar purposeful but serve no obvious adaptive function or
purpose and stop with distraction. Examples  include repetitive hand waving/rotating,
arm flapping, and finger wiggling. Motor stereo typies can be differentiated from tics based
on the former’s earlier age at onset (younger than 3 years), prolonged duration (seconds to
minutes), constant repetitive fixed form and location, exacer bation when engrossed in ac-
tivities, lack of a premonitory urge, and ce ssation with distraction (e.g., name called or
touched). Chorea  represents rapid, random, continua l, abrupt, irregular, unpredictable,
nonstereotyped actions that are usually bilatera l and affect all parts of the body (i.e., face,
trunk, and limbs). The timing, direction, and dist ribution of movements vary from mo-
ment to moment, and movements usually worsen during attempted voluntary action. Dys-
tonia  is the simultaneous sustained contracture of both agonist and antagonist muscles,
resulting in a distorted posture or movement of parts of the bo dy. Dystonic postures are of-
ten triggered by attempts at voluntary movements and are not seen during sleep",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,129

cur as dystonic or choreoathetoid movement s that are precipitated by voluntary move-
ment or exertion and less commonly arise from normal background activity",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,129
"Myoclonus. Myoclonus is characterized by a sudden unidirectional movement that is

itory urge",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,129

behaviors from tics may be difficult. Clues fa voring an obsessive-compulsive behavior in-
clude a cognitive-based drive (e.g., fear of co ntamination) and the n eed to perform the ac-
tion in a particular fashion a certain number of  times, equally on both sides of the body, or
until a “just right” feeling is achieved. Impulse-control proble ms and other repetitive be-

"87Schizophrenia Spectrum and
Other Psychotic Disorders
Schizophrenia spectrum  and other psychotic disorders include schizophrenia,
other psychotic disorders, and schizotypal (per sonality) disorder. They are defined by ab-
normalities in one or more of the following fi ve domains: delusions, hallucinations, disor-
ganized thinking (speech), grossly disorganiz ed or abnormal moto r behavior (including
catatonia), and negative symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,132
"Key Features That Define the Psychotic Disorders
Delusions
Delusions  are fixed beliefs that are not amenable to  change in light of conflicting evidence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,132
"Their content may include a variety of themes (e.g., persecutory, referential, somatic, reli-
gious, grandiose). Persecutory delusions  (i.e., belief that one is going to be harmed, harassed,
and so forth by an individual, organizat ion, or other group) are most common. Referential
delusions  (i.e., belief that certain gestures, comm ents, environmental cues, and so forth are
directed at oneself) are also common. Grandiose delusions  (i.e., when an individual believes
that he or she has exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame) and erotomanic delusions  (i.e., when
an individual believes falsely that another person  is in love with him or her) are also seen",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,132
"Nihilistic delusions  involve the conviction that a ma jor catastrophe will occur, and somatic
delusions  focus on preoccupations regarding health and organ function",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,132
"Delusions are deemed bizarre  if they are clearly implausible and not understandable to
same-culture peers and do not derive from or dinary life experiences.  An example of a bi-
zarre delusion is the belief that an outside forc e has removed his or her internal organs and
replaced them with someone else’s organs wi thout leaving any wounds or scars. An ex-
ample of a nonbizarre delusion is the belief that  one is under surveilla nce by the police, de-
spite a lack of convincing evidence. Delusion s that express a loss of control over mind or
body are generally considered to be bizarre; these include th e belief that one’s thoughts
have been “removed” by some outside force (thought withdrawal ), that alien thoughts have
been put into one’s mind ( thought insertion ), or that one’s body or actions are being acted on
or manipulated by so me outside force ( delusions of control ). The distinction between a de-
lusion and a strongly held idea is sometimes di fficult to make and depends in part on the
degree of conviction with which the belief is held despite clear or reasonable contradictory
evidence regarding its veracity. 
Hallucinations
Hallucinations  are perception-like experiences that occur without an external stimulus",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,132
"They are vivid and clear, with the full force and impact of normal perceptions, and not
under voluntary control. They may occur in any sensory modality, but auditory halluci-
nations are the most common in schizophrenia  and related disorders. Auditory hallucina-
tions are usually experienced as voices, whethe r familiar or unfamiliar, that are perceived
as distinct from the individual’s own though ts. The hallucinations must occur in the con-
text of a clear sensorium; those that occur while falling asleep ( hypnagogic ) or waking up",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,132
"88 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
(hypnopompic ) are considered to be within the rang e of normal experience. Hallucinations
may be a normal part of religious expe rience in certain cultural contexts. 
Disorganized Thinking (Speech)
Disorganized thinking  (formal thought disorder ) is typically inferred from the individual’s
speech. The individual may switch from one topic to another ( derailment or loose associa-
tions ). Answers to questions may be oblique ly related or completely unrelated ( tangential-
ity). Rarely, speech may be so severely disorgan ized that it is nearly incomprehensible and
resembles receptive aphasia in its linguistic disorganization ( incoherence  or “word salad”)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,133
"Because mildly disorganized speech is common and nonspecific, the symptom must be se-
vere enough to substantially impair effective communication. The severity of the impair-
ment may be difficult to evaluate if the person making the diagnosis comes from a
different linguistic background than that of the person being examin ed. Less severe dis-
organized thinking or speech may occur du ring the prodromal and residual periods of
schizophrenia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,133
"Grossly Disorganized or Abnormal Motor Behavior 
(Including Catatonia)
Grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior  may manifest itself in a variety of ways,
ranging from childlike “silliness” to unpred ictable agitation. Problems may be noted in
any form of goal-directed behavior, leading to difficulties in performing activities of daily
living",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,133
"Catatonic behavior  is a marked decrease in reactivity to the environment. This ranges
from resistance to  instructions ( negativism ); to maintaining a rigid, inappropriate or bi-
zarre posture; to a complete lack  of verbal and motor responses ( mutism  and stupor ). It can
also include purposeless and excessive motor activity without obvious cause ( catatonic
excitement ). Other features are repeated stereo typed movements, staring, grimacing,
mutism, and the echoing of speech. Although catatonia has historically been associated
with schizophrenia, catatonic symptoms are nonspecific and may occur in other mental
disorders (e.g., bipolar or depressive disorder s with catatonia) and in medical conditions
(catatonic disorder due to another medical condition)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,133
"Negative Symptoms
Negative symptoms  account for a substantial portion of the morbidity associated with
schizophrenia but are less prominent in other psychotic disorders. Two negative symp-
toms are particularly prominent in schizophrenia: diminished emotional expression and
avolition. Diminished emotional expression includes reductions in the expression of emo-
tions in the face, eye contact, intonation of speech (prosody), and movements of the hand,
head, and face that normally give an emotional emphasis to speech. Avolition  is a decrease
in motivated self-initiated purposeful activities. The individual may sit for long periods of
time and show little interest in  participating in work or so cial activities. Other negative
symptoms include alogia, anhedonia, and asociality. Alogia  is manifested by diminished
speech output. Anhedonia  is the decreased ability to ex perience pleasure from positive
stimuli or a degradation in the recollection of pleasure previously experienced. Asociality
refers to the apparent lack of interest in so cial interactions and may be associated with avo-
lition, but it can also be a ma nifestation of limited opportunities for social interactions.

"Clinician-Rated Assessment of Symptoms and
 Related Clinical Phenomena in Psychosis
Psychotic disorders are heterogeneous, and th e severity of symptoms can predict impor-
tant aspects of the illness, such as the degree of cognitive or neur obiological deficits. To
move the field forward, a detailed framework fo r the assessment of severity is included in
Section III “Assessment Measures,” which may help with treatment planning, prognostic
decision making, and research on patho physiological mechanisms. Section III “Assess-
ment Measures” also contains dimensional as sessments of the primary symptoms of psy-
chosis, including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech (except for substance/
medication-induced psychotic disorder and psychotic disorder due to another medical
condition), abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms, as well as dimen-
sional assessments of depression and mania. Th e severity of mood symptoms in psychosis
has prognostic value  and guides treatment. There is growing evidence that schizoaffective",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,134
"90 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
disorder is not a distinct nosological catego ry. Thus, dimensional assessments of depres-
sion and mania for all psychotic disorders alert clinicians to mood pathology and the need
to treat where appropriate. The Section III sc ale also includes a dimensional assessment of
cognitive impairment. Many individuals with psychotic disorders have impairments in a
range of cognitive domains that predict functi onal status. Clinical neuropsychological as-
sessment can help guide diagnosis and treatm ent, but brief assessments without formal
neuropsychological assessment can provide us eful information that can be sufficient for
diagnostic purposes. Formal neuropsychological  testing, when conducted, should be ad-
ministered and scored by personnel trained in  the use of testing instruments. If a formal
neuropsychological assessment is not conducted, the clinician should use the best avail-
able information to make a judgment. Furthe r research on these assessments is necessary
in order to determine their c linical utility; thus, the assessments available in Section III
should serve as a prototype to  stimulate such research",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,135
"Schizotypal (Personality) Disorder
Criteria and text for schizotypal personality disorder can be found in the chapter “Person-

disorders, and is labeled in this section of ICD-9 and ICD-10 as schizotypal disorder, it is
listed in this chapter and disc ussed in detail in the DSM-5 chapter “Personality Disorders.”

"Subtypes
In erotomanic type,  the central theme of the delusion is that another person is in love with
the individual. The person about whom this conviction is held is usually of higher status
(e.g., a famous individual or a superior at work) but can be a complete stranger. Efforts to
contact the object of the delusion are common. In grandiose type, the central theme of the de-
lusion is the conviction of having some great talent or insight or of having made some im-
portant discovery. Less commo nly, the individual may have  the delusion of having a
special relationship with a prominent individu al or of being a prominent person (in which
case the actual individual may be regarded as an impostor). Grandiose delusions may
have a religious content. In jealous type,  the central theme of the delusion is that of an un-
faithful partner. This belief is arrived at with out due cause and is based on incorrect infer-
ences supported by small bits of “evidence”  (e.g., disarrayed clothing). The individual
with the delusion usually conf ronts the spouse or lover and at tempts to intervene in the
imagined infidelity. In persecutory type,  the central theme of the delusion involves the in-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,136
"92 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
dividual’s belief of being conspired against,  cheated, spied on, followed, poisoned, mali-
ciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals. Small slights
may be exaggerated and become the focus of a delusional system. The affected individual
may engage in repeated attempts to obtain sat isfaction by legal or legislative action. Indi-
viduals with persecutory delusions are often resentful and angry and may resort to vio-
lence against those they believe are hurting them. In somatic type,  the central theme of the
delusion involves bodily functi ons or sensations. Somatic de lusions can occur in several
forms. Most common is the belief that the indi vidual emits a foul odor ; that there is an in-
festation of insects on or in the skin; that ther e is an internal parasite; that certain parts of
the body are misshapen or ugly; or that parts of the body are not functioning",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,137
"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of delusional disorder is the presence of one or more delusions that
persist for at least 1 month (Criterion A). A diagnosis of delusional disorder is not given if
the individual has ever had a symptom presen tation that met Criterion A for schizophre-
nia (Criterion B). Apart from the direct impact  of the delusions, impairments in psychoso-
cial functioning may be more circumscribed th an those seen in other psychotic disorders
such as schizophrenia, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd (Criterion C). If mood
episodes occur concurrently with the delusions , the total duration of these mood episodes
is brief relative to the total duration of the delusional periods (Criterion D). The delusions
are not attributable  to the physiological effects of a su bstance (e.g., cocaine) or another
medical condition (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease) and are not better explained by another men-
tal disorder, such as body dy smorphic disorder or obsessive- compulsive disorder (Crite-
rion E)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,137
"In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the
assessment of cognition, depression, and mani a symptom domains is vital for making crit-
ically important distinctions between the va rious schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-
chotic disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,137
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Social, marital, or work problems can result from the delusional beliefs of delusional dis-
order. Individuals with delusional disorder ma y be able to factually describe that others
view their beliefs as irrational  but are unable to accept this themselves (i.e., there may be
“factual insight” but no true  insight). Many individuals de velop irritable or dysphoric
mood, which can usually be understood as a re action to their delusional beliefs. Anger and
violent behavior can occur with persecutory, jealous, and erotomanic types. The individ-
ual may engage in litigious or antagonistic behavior (e.g., sending hundreds of letters of
protest to the government). Legal difficulties can occur, particularly in jealous and eroto-
manic types. 
Prevalence
The lifetime prevalence of delusional disorder has been estimated at around 0.2%, and the
most frequent subtype is persecutory. Delu sional disorder, jealous type, is probably more
common in males than in females, but there ar e no major gender differences in the overall
frequency of delu sional disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,137
"Development and Course
On average, global function is generally better than that observed in schizophrenia. Al-
though the diagnosis is generally stable, a pr oportion of individuals go on to develop",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,137

schizophrenia and schizotypal personality diso rder. Although it can occur in younger age
groups, the condition may be more  prevalent in older individuals",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,138
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
An individual’s cultural and religious backgr ound must be taken into  account in evaluat-
ing the possible presence of delusional di sorder. The content of delusions also varies
across cultural contexts",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,138
"Functional Consequences of Delusional Disorder
The functional impairment is usually more ci rcumscribed than that seen with other psy-
chotic disorders, although in some cases, the impairment may be substantial and include
poor occupational functioning and social isola tion. When poor psychosocial functioning is
present, delusional beliefs themselves ofte n play a significant role. A common character-
istic of individuals with delusional disorder is the apparent normality of their behavior
and appearance when their delusional idea s are not being discussed or acted on. 
Differential Diagnosis
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. If an individual wi th obsessive-compul-
sive disorder is completely convinced that his or her obsessive-comp ulsive disorder beliefs
are true, then the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, with absent insight/delu-
sional beliefs specifier, should be given rath er than a diagnosis of delusional disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,138
"Similarly, if an individual with body dysm orphic disorder is completely convinced that
his or her body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true, then the diagnosis of body dysmor-
phic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than
a diagnosis of delusional disorder. 
Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, psychotic disorder due to another medical con-
dition, and substance/medicati on-induced psychotic disorder. Individuals with these
disorders may present with symptoms that su ggest delusional disorder. For example, sim-
ple persecutory delusions in the context of major neurocognitive di sorder would be di-
agnosed as major neurocognitive  disorder, with behavioral  disturbance. A substance/
medication-induced psychotic disorder cross-sectionally may be identical in symptom-
atology to delusional disorder but can be di stinguished by the chronological relationship
of substance use to the onset and remission of the delusional beliefs",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,138
"Schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder. Delusional disorder can be distinguished
from schizophrenia and schizophreniform disord er by the absence of the other character-
istic symptoms of the active phase of schizophrenia. 
Depressive and bipolar disorders and schizoaffective disorder. These disorders may
be distinguished from delusional disorder by  the temporal relationship between the mood
disturbance and the delusions and by the severi ty of the mood symptoms. If delusions oc-
cur exclusively during mood episodes, the diag nosis is depressive or  bipolar disorder with
psychotic features. Mood sympto ms that meet full criteria for a mood episode can be su-
perimposed on delusional disorder. Delusional di sorder can be diagnose d only if the total
duration of all mood episodes remains brief rela tive to the total duration of the delusional
disturbance. If not, then a diagnosis of othe r specified or unspecified schizophrenia spec-
trum and other psychotic diso rder accompanied by other sp ecified depressi ve disorder,

psychotic disorder (i.e., duration of active symptoms is 1–6 months  as opposed to remis-
sion within 1 month) are more common in developing countries than in developed coun-
tries. Brief psychotic diso rder is twofold more common in females than in males",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,140
"Development and Course
Brief psychotic disorder may appear in adolescence or early adulthood, and onset can oc-
cur across the lifespan, with the average age at onset being the mid 30s. By definition, a
diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder requir es a full remission of all symptoms and an
eventual full return to the premorbid level of functioning within 1 mont h of the onset of the
disturbance. In some individuals, the duration of psychotic symptoms may be quite brief
(e.g., a few days)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,140
"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental.  Preexisting personality disorders an d traits (e.g., schizotypal person-
ality disorder; borderline personality disorder; or traits in the psychoticism domain, such
as perceptual dysregulation, and the negative affectivity domain, such as suspiciousness)
may predispose the individual to the development of the disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,140
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
It is important to distinguish symptoms of br ief psychotic disorder from culturally sanc-
tioned response patterns. For example, in so me religious ceremonies, an individual may
report hearing voices, but these do not genera lly persist and are not perceived as abnormal
by most members of the indivi dual’s community. In addition , cultural and religious back-
ground must be taken into account when considering whether be liefs are delusional. 
Functional Consequences of  Brief Psychotic Disorder
Despite high rates of relapse, for most indivi duals, outcome is excellent in terms of social
functioning and symptomatology.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,140
"96 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
Differential Diagnosis
Other medical conditions. A variety of medical disorders can manifest with psychotic
symptoms of short duration. Psychotic disorder  due to another medica l condition or a de-
lirium is diagnosed when there is evidence from  the history, physical examination, or lab-
oratory tests that the delusions or hallucinati ons are the direct physiological consequence
of a specific medical condition (e.g., Cushing’s syndrome, brain tumor) (see “Psychotic
Disorder Due to Another Medical Co ndition” later in this chapter). 
Substance-related disorders. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, sub-
stance-induced delirium, and substance intoxication are distinguished from brief psychotic
disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure to a toxin)
is judged to be etiologically related to the psychotic symp toms (see “Substance/Medication-
Induced Psychotic Disorder” later in this chapte r). Laboratory tests, such as a urine drug
screen or a blood alcohol level, may be helpful in making this determination, as may a care-
ful history of substance use with attention to  temporal relationships between substance in-
take and onset of the symp toms and to the nature of the substance being used",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,141
"Depressive and bipolar disorders. The diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder cannot be
made if the psychotic symptoms are better explained by a mood episode (i.e., the psychotic
symptoms occur exclusively during a full major depressive, manic, or mixed episode). 
Other psychotic disorders. If the psychotic symptoms pers ist for 1 month or longer, the
diagnosis is either schizophr eniform disorder, delusional disorder, depressive disorder
with psychotic features, bipolar disorder with psychotic fe atures, or other specified or un-
specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, depending on the other
symptoms in the presentation. The differentia l diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder
and schizophreniform disorder is difficult wh en the psychotic symptoms have remitted be-
fore 1 month in response to successful trea tment with medication. Careful attention should
be given to the possibility that a recurrent diso rder (e.g., bipolar disorder, recurrent acute ex-
acerbations of schizophrenia) may be respon sible for any recurring  psychotic episodes",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,141
"Malingering and factitious disorders. An episode of factitious disorder, with predomi-

"Diagnostic Features
The characteristic symptoms of  schizophreniform disorder are identical to those of schizo-
phrenia (Criterion A). Schizophreniform disorder is distinguish ed by its difference in du-
ration: the total duration of the illness, includ ing prodromal, active, and residual phases, is
at least 1 month but less than 6 months (Crite rion B). The duration requirement for schizo-
phreniform disorder is intermediate between th at for brief psychotic disorder, which lasts
more than 1 day and remits by 1 month, and schizophrenia, which lasts for at least 6 months",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,142
"The diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made under two conditions. 1) when an ep-
isode of illness lasts between 1 and 6 months and the individual has already recovered,
and 2) when an individual is symptomatic for less than the 6 months’ duration required for
the diagnosis of schizophrenia but has not yet recovered. In this case, the diagnosis should
be noted as “schizophreniform disorder (provisional)” because it is uncertain if the indi-
vidual will recover from the disturbance within  the 6-month period. If the disturbance per-
sists beyond 6 months, the diagnosis should be changed to schizophrenia.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,142
"98 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
Another distinguishing feature of schizophren iform disorder is the lack of a criterion
requiring impaired social and occupational functioning. While such  impairments may po-
tentially be present, they are not necessary for a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. 
In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the
assessment of cognition, depression, and mani a symptom domains is vital for making crit-
ically important distinctions between the va rious schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-
chotic disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,143
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
As with schizophrenia, currently there are no laboratory or psychometric tests for schizo-
phreniform disorder. There are multiple brain regions where ne uroimaging, neuropa-
thological, and neurophy siological research has indicated abnormalities, but none are
diagnostic",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,143
"Prevalence
Incidence of schizophreniform disorder across sociocultural settings is likely similar to
that observed in schizophrenia. In the United States and other developed countries, the in-
cidence is low, possibly fivefold less than th at of schizophrenia. In developing countries,
the incidence may be higher, especially for th e specifier “with good prognostic features”;
in some of these settings schizophreniform disorder may be as common as schizophrenia. 
Development and Course
The development of schizophreniform disorder  is similar to that of schizophrenia. About
one-third of individuals with an initial di agnosis of schizophreniform disorder (provi-
sional) recover within the 6-mo nth period and schizophreniform disorder is their final di-
agnosis. The majority of the remaining two-th irds of individuals will eventually receive a
diagnosis of schizophrenia or  schizoaffective disorder. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Genetic and physiological. Relatives of individuals with  schizophreniform disorder
have an increased risk for schizophrenia. 
Functional Consequences of 
Schizophreniform Disorder
For the majority of individuals with schizo phreniform disorder who eventually receive a
diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the functional consequences are
similar to the consequences of those disorder s. Most individuals ex perience dysfunction in
several areas of daily functioning, such as sc hool or work, interperso nal relationships, and
self-care. Individuals who recover from schi zophreniform disorder ha ve better functional
outcomes.

The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia involve a range of cogn itive, behavioral, and
emotional dysfunctions, but no single sympto m is pathognomonic of the disorder. The di-
agnosis involves the recognition of a constellation of sign s and symptoms associated with
impaired occupational or social functioning. Individuals with the disorder will vary sub-
stantially on most features, as schizophrenia is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,145
"At least two Criterion A symptoms must be  present for a significant portion of time
during a 1-month period or longer. At least one of these symptoms must be the clear pres-
ence of delusions (Criterion A1), hallucinati ons (Criterion A2), or disorganized speech
(Criterion A3). Grossly disorganized or ca tatonic behavior (Criterion A4) and negative
symptoms (Criterion A5) may also be present.  In those situations in which the active-
phase symptoms remit within a mo nth in response to treatment, Criterion A is still met if the
clinician estimates that they would have persisted in the absence of treatment. 
Schizophrenia involves impairment in one or more major areas of functioning (Crite-
rion B). If the disturbance begins in childhood or adolescence,  the expected level of func-
tion is not attained. Co mparing the individual with unaffected siblings may be helpful. The
dysfunction persists for a substantial period du ring the course of the disorder and does not
appear to be a direct result of any single feature. Avolition (i.e., reduced drive to pursue
goal-directed behavior; Criterion A5) is linked to the social dysfunction described under
Criterion B. There is also strong evidence for a relationship betw een cognitive impairment

lusional proportions (e.g., ideas of reference or  magical thinking); they may have unusual
perceptual experiences (e.g., sensing the pres ence of an unseen person); their speech may
be generally understandable but vague; and their behavior may be unusual but not grossly

Individuals with schizophrenia may display inappropriate affect (e.g., laughing in the ab-
sence of an appropriate stimulus); a dysphoric mood that can take the form of depression,
anxiety, or anger; a disturbed sleep pattern (e.g., daytime sleeping and nighttime activity);
and a lack of interest in eating or food refu sal. Depersonalization, derealization, and so-
matic concerns may occur and sometimes reac h delusional proportions. Anxiety and pho-
bias are common. Cognitive deficits in schi zophrenia are common and are strongly linked
to vocational and functional impairments. Thes e deficits can include decrements in declar-
ative memory, working memory, language function, and other executive functions, as well
as slower processing speed. Ab normalities in sensory processing and inhibitory capacity,
as well as reductions in attention, are also  found. Some individuals with schizophrenia
show social cognition deficits, including deficits in the ability to infer the intentions of
other people (theory of mind), and may attend  to and then interpret irrelevant events or
stimuli as meaningful, perhaps leading to th e generation of explanatory delusions. These
impairments frequently persist during symptomatic remission",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,146
"Some individuals with psychosis may lack insi ght or awareness of their disorder (i.e.,
anosognosia). This lack of “insight” includes  unawareness of symptoms of schizophrenia
and may be present throughout the entire cour se of the illness. Unawareness of illness is
typically a symptom of schizophrenia itself rath er than a coping strategy. It is comparable
to the lack of awareness of neurological  deficits following brain damage, termed anoso-
gnosia.  This symptom is the most common predicto r of non-adherence to treatment, and it
predicts higher relapse rates, increased numb er of involuntary trea tments, poorer psycho-
social functioning, aggression, and a poorer course of illness. 
Hostility and aggression can be associated  with schizophrenia, although spontaneous
or random assault is uncommon. Aggression is more frequent for younger males and for
individuals with a past history of violence, non-adherenc e with treatment, substance
abuse, and impulsivity. It should be noted that the vast majority of persons with schizo-

"Prevalence
The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia appears to be approximately 0.3%–0.7%, al-
though there is reported variation by race/ethnicity, across countries, and by geographic
origin for immigrants and children of immigr ants. The sex ratio differs across samples and
populations: for example, an emphasis on nega tive symptoms and longer duration of dis-
order (associated with poorer outcome) show s higher incidence rates for males, whereas
definitions allowing for the inclusion of more mood symptoms and brief presentations
(associated with better outcome) show  equivalent risks for both sexes. 
Development and Course
The psychotic features of schizophrenia typically emerge between the late teens and the
mid-30s; onset prior to adolescence is rare. The peak age at onset for the first psychotic ep-
isode is in the early- to mid-20s for males and in the late-20s for females. The onset may be
abrupt or insidious, but the majority of individuals manifest a slow and gradual develop-
ment of a variety of clinically significant signs and symptoms. Half  of these individuals
complain of depressive symptoms. Earlier age at onset has traditionally been seen as a pre-
dictor of worse prognosis. However, the effect of age at onset is likely related to gender,
with males having worse premorbid adjustment, lower educational achievement, more
prominent negative symptoms and cognitiv e impairment, and in general a worse out-
come. Impaired cognition is common, and altera tions in cognition are present during de-
velopment and precede the emergence of psycho sis, taking the form of stable cognitive
impairments during adulthood. Cognitive impairments may persist when other symptoms
are in remission and contribute to the disability of the disease. 
The predictors of course and outcome are la rgely unexplained, and course and outcome
may not be reliably predicted. The course appears to be favorable in about 20% of those
with schizophrenia, and a small number of indi viduals are reported to recover completely",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,147
"However, most individuals with schizophrenia still require formal or informal daily living
supports, and many remain chronically ill, with exacerbations and remissions of active
symptoms, while others have a course of progressive deterioration",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,147
"Psychotic symptoms tend to diminish over the life course, perhaps in association with
normal age-related declines in dopamine activity. Negative symptoms are more closely re-
lated to prognosis than are positive symptoms and tend to be the most persistent. Further-
more, cognitive deficits associated with the illness may not improve over the course of the
illness",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,147
"The essential features of schizophrenia are th e same in childhood, but it is more diffi-
cult to make the diagnosis. In children, delu sions and hallucinations may be less elaborate
than in adults, and visual hallucinations are more common and should be distinguished
from normal fantasy play. Disorganized speec h occurs in many disorders with childhood

"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Environmental. Season of birth has been linked to the incidence of schizophrenia, in-
cluding late winter/early spring in some locations and summer for the deficit form of the
disease. The incidence of schizophrenia and related disorders is high er for children grow-
ing up in an urban environment an d for some minority ethnic groups. 
Genetic and physiological. There is a strong contribution  for genetic factors in deter-
mining risk for schizophrenia, although most individuals who have been diagnosed with
schizophrenia have no family history of psyc hosis. Liability is conferred by a spectrum of
risk alleles, common and rare, with each allele contributing only a small fraction to the to-
tal population variance. The risk alleles identi fied to date are also associated with other
mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, depression, an d autism spectrum disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,148
"Pregnancy and birth complications with hypoxia and greater paternal age are associated
with a higher risk of schizophrenia for the developing fetus. In addition, other prenatal
and perinatal adversities, including stress, in fection, malnutrition, maternal diabetes, and
other medical conditions, have been linked wi th schizophrenia. However, the vast major-
ity of offspring with these risk factors do not deve lop schizophrenia. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
Cultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly  when the individual
and the clinician do not share the same cult ural and socioeconomic background. Ideas that
appear to be delusional in one culture (e.g.,  witchcraft) may be commonly held in another",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,148
"In some cultures, visual or auditory halluci nations with a religious  content (e.g., hearing

cultures. The assessment of affect requires sens itivity to differences in  styles of emotional
expression, eye contact, and body language, wh ich vary across cultures. If the assessment
is conducted in a language that is differen t from the individual’s  primary language, care
must be taken to ensure that alogia is not rela ted to linguistic barriers. In certain cultures,
distress may take the form of hallucinations or pseudo -hallucinations and overvalued

tient’s subgroup",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,148
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues 
A number of features distinguish the clinical expression of schizophrenia in females and
males. The general incidence of schizophrenia tends to be slightly lower in females, par-

peak as described earlier (see the section “D evelopment and Course” for this disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,148

"Finally, social functioning tends to remain better preserved in females. There are, how-
ever, frequent exceptions to these general caveats. 
Suicide Risk 
Approximately 5%–6% of individuals with schizophrenia die by suicide, about 20% attempt
suicide on one or more occasions, and many mo re have significant suicidal ideation. Suicidal
behavior is sometimes in response to command  hallucinations to harm oneself or others",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,149
"Suicide risk remains high over the whole lifespan for males an d females, although it may be
especially high for younger males with comorb id substance use. Other risk factors include
having depressive symptoms or feelings of hopelessness and being unemployed, and the
risk is higher, also, in the period after a psychotic episode or hospital discharge",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,149
"Functional Consequences of Schizophrenia 
Schizophrenia is associated with significant social and occupational dysfunction. Making
educational progress and maintaining employment are frequently impaired by avolition
or other disorder manifestatio ns, even when the cognitive sk ills are sufficient for the tasks
at hand. Most individuals are employed at a lower level than their parents, and most, par-
ticularly men, do not marry or have limited social contacts outside of their family",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,149
"Differential Diagnosis 
Major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic or catatonic features. The distinc-
tion between schizophrenia and major depre ssive or bipolar disorder with psychotic
features or with catatonia depends on the te mporal relationship between the mood distur-
bance and the psychosis, and on the severity of the depressive or manic symptoms. If de-
lusions or hallucinations occur exclusively during a major depressive or manic episode,
the diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with ps ychotic features. 
Schizoaffective disorder. A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that a major
depressive or manic episode occur concurrently  with the active-phase symptoms and that
the mood symptoms be present for a majority of the total duration of the active periods",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,149
"Schizophreniform disorder an d brief psychotic disorder. These disorders are of shorter
duration than schizophrenia as specified in Cr iterion C, which requires 6 months of symp-

the absence of the other symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia (e.g., delusions, prom-

Autism spectrum disorder or communication disorders. These disorders may also have
symptoms resembling a psychotic episode but are distinguished by their respective defi-
cits in social interaction with repetitive an d restricted behaviors and other cognitive and
communication deficits. An individual with autism spectrum disord er or communication
disorder must have symptoms that meet fu ll criteria for schizophrenia, with prominent
hallucinations or delusions for at least 1 mont h, in order to be diagnosed with schizophre-
nia as a comorbid condition",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,150
"Other mental disorders associated with a psychotic episode. The diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia is made only when the psychotic episode  is persistent and not attributable to the
physiological effects of a subs tance or another medical condit ion. Individuals with a de-
lirium or major or minor neurocognitive disorder may present with psychotic symptoms,
but these would have a temporal relationship to the onset of cognit ive changes consistent
with those disorders. Individuals with subs tance/medication-induced psychotic disorder
may present with symptoms char acteristic of Criterion A for schizophrenia, but the sub-
stance/medication-induced psyc hotic disorder can usually be distinguished by the chron-
ological relationship of subs tance use to the onset and remi ssion of the psychosis in the
absence of substance use. 
Comorbidity 
Rates of comorbidity with substance-relate d disorders are high in schizophrenia. Over
half of individuals with schizophrenia have  tobacco use disorder and smoke cigarettes
regularly. Comorbidity with anxiety disorder s is increasingly recognized in schizophre-
nia. Rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder are elevated in individuals
with schizophrenia compared with the general population. Schizotypal or paranoid per-
sonality disorder may sometimes pr ecede the onset of schizophrenia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,150

"Diagnostic Features
The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is based on the assessment of an uninterrupted
period of illness during which the individual co ntinues to display active or residual symp-
toms of psychotic illness. The diagnosis is usually, but not necessarily, made during the
period of psychotic illness. At some time during the period, Criterion A for schizophrenia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,151
"Schizoaffective Disorder 107
has to be met. Criteria B (soc ial dysfunction) and F (exclusion  of autism sp ectrum disorder
or other communication disorder of childhood onset) for schizophrenia do not have to be
met. In addition to meeting Criterion A for schizophrenia, there is a major mood episode
(major depressive or manic) (Criterion A for schizoaffective disorder). Because loss of in-
terest or pleasure is common in schizophrenia,  to meet Criterion A for schizoaffective dis-
order, the major depressive episode must in clude pervasive depressed mood (i.e., the
presence of markedly diminished interest or pleasure is not sufficie nt). Episodes of de-
pression or mania are present for the majority of  the total duration of the illness (i.e., after
Criterion A has been met) (Criterion C for schi zoaffective disorder). To separate schizoaf-
fective disorder from a depressive or bipola r disorder with psychotic features, delusions
or hallucinations must be present for at least  2 weeks in the absence of a major mood epi-
sode (depressive or manic) at some point duri ng the lifetime duration  of the illness (Cri-
terion B for schizoaffective disorder). The symptoms must not be attributable to the effects
of a substance or another medical condition (Criterion D for schi zoaffective disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,152
"Criterion C for schizoaf fective disorder specifies that mood symptoms meeting criteria
for a major mood episode must be present for the majority of the total duration of the ac-
tive and residual portion of the illness. Criter ion C requires the asses sment of mood symp-
toms for the entire course of a psychotic illnes s, which differs from th e criterion in DSM-IV,
which required only an assessment of the curr ent period of illness. If the mood symptoms
are present for only a relative ly brief period, the diagnosis is schizophrenia, not schizoaf-
fective disorder. When deciding whether an individual’s presentation meets Criterion C,
the clinician should review the total duration of psychotic illness (i.e., both active and re-
sidual symptoms) and determine when significa nt mood symptoms (untreated or in need
of treatment with antidepressant and/or mo od-stabilizing medication) accompanied the
psychotic symptoms. This determination requir es sufficient histor ical information and
clinical judgment. For example, an individual with a 4-year history of active and residual
symptoms of schizophrenia develops depressi ve and manic episodes that, taken together,
do not occupy more than 1 year during the 4- year history of psycho tic illness. This presen-
tation would not meet Criterion C",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,152
"In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the
assessment of cognition, depression, and mani a symptom domains is vital for making crit-
ically important distinctions between the va rious schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-
chotic disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,152
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Occupational functioning is frequently impair ed, but this is not a defining criterion (in
contrast to schizophrenia). Restricted social contact and difficulties with self-care are as-
sociated with schizoaffective disorder, but negative symptoms  may be less severe and less
persistent than those seen in schizophrenia. Anosognosia (i.e., poor insight) is also com-
mon in schizoaffective disorder, but the deficits in insight may be less severe and perva-
sive than those in schizophrenia. Individual s with schizoaffective disorder may be at
increased risk for later developing episodes of  major depressive disorder or bipolar disor-
der if mood symptoms contin ue following the remission of symptoms meeting Criterion A
for schizophrenia. There may be associated al cohol and other substance-related disorders. 
There are no tests or biological measures that can assist in making the diagnosis of
schizoaffective disorder. Whether schizoaffe ctive disorder differs from schizophrenia
with regard to associated features such as structural or function al brain abnormalities,
cognitive deficits, or geneti c risk factors is not clear",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,152

schizoaffective disorder is higher  in females than in males, mainly due to an increased in-
cidence of the depressive type among females",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,153
"Development and Course
The typical age at onset of schizoaffective di sorder is early adulthood, although onset can
occur anywhere from adolescence to late in lif e. A significant number of individuals diag-
nosed with another psychotic illness initially will receive the diagnosis schizoaffective dis-
order later when the pattern of mood epis odes has become more apparent. With the
current diagnostic Criterion C, it is expected  that the diagnosis for some individuals will
convert from schizoaffective d isorder to another disorder as mood symptoms become less
prominent. The prognosis for schizoaffective di sorder is somewhat better than the prog-
nosis for schizophrenia but worse than the prognosis for mood disorders. 
Schizoaffective disorder may occur in a variety of temporal patterns. The following is
a typical pattern: An individual may have pronounced auditory hallucinations and per-
secutory delusions for 2 months  before the onset of a prom inent major depressive episode",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,153
The psychotic symptoms and the full major depr essive episode are then present for 3 months,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,153
"Then, the individual recovers completely fr om the major depressive episode, but the psy-
chotic symptoms persist for another month be fore they too disappear. During this period
of illness, the individual’s symptoms concurre ntly met criteria for a major depressive ep-
isode and Criterion A for schizophrenia, and during this same period of illness, auditory
hallucinations and delusions were present both before and after the depressive phase. The
total period of illness lasted for about 6 mo nths, with psychotic sy mptoms alone present
during the initial 2 months, both depressive  and psychotic symptoms present during the
next 3 months, and psychotic symptoms alone pr esent during the last month. In this in-
stance, the duration of the depressive episode was not brief relative to the total duration of
the psychotic disturbance, and thus the presen tation qualifies for a diagnosis of schizoaf-
fective disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,153
"The expression of psychotic symptoms across the lifespan is variable. Depressive or
manic symptoms can occur before the onset of psychosis, during acute psychotic episodes,
during residual periods, and after cessation of psychosis. For example, an individual
might present with prominent mood symptoms  during the prodromal stage of schizo-
phrenia. This pattern is not necessarily indicative  of schizoaffective disorder, since it is the
co-occurrence of psychotic and mood symptoms  that is diagnostic. For an individual with
symptoms that clearly meet the criteria for sc hizoaffective disorder but who on further fol-
low-up only presents with residual psychoti c symptoms (such as subthreshold psychosis
and/or prominent negative symptoms), the diagnosis may be changed to schizophrenia,
as the total proportion of psychotic illness compared with mood symptoms becomes more
prominent. Schizoaffective diso rder, bipolar type, may be more common in young adults,
whereas schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, may be more common in older adults. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. Among individuals with schizophrenia, there may be an in-
creased risk for schizoaffective disorder in first-degree relatives. The risk for schizoaffec-
tive disorder may be increased among indivi duals who have a first- degree relative with
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
Cultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly  when the individual
and the clinician do not share the same cultur al and economic backgr ound. Ideas that ap-
pear to be delusional in one culture (e.g., witchcraft) may be commonly held in another",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,153

"Suicide Risk 
The lifetime risk of suicide for schizophreni a and schizoaffective disorder is 5%, and the
presence of depressive symptoms is correlated with a higher risk for suicide. There is ev-
idence that suicide rates are higher in North American populations than in European,
Eastern European, South American, and Indian  populations of individuals with schizo-
phrenia or schizoaffective disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,154

function is not a diagnostic criterion (as it is for schizophrenia), an d there is substantial
variability between individuals diagno sed with schizoaffective disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,154
"Differential Diagnosis
Other mental disorders and medical conditions. A wide variety of psychiatric and med-
ical conditions can manifest with psychotic and mood symptoms that must be considered
in the differential diagnosis of  schizoaffective disorder. Th ese include psychotic disorder
due to another medical condition; delirium; major neurocognitive disorder; substance/
medication-induced psychotic disorder or neurocognitive disorder; bipolar disorders
with psychotic features; major depressive diso rder with psychotic features; depressive or
bipolar disorders with catatonic features; schi zotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality
disorder; brief psychotic disorder; schizophre niform disorder; schizophrenia; delusional
disorder; and other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders. Medical conditions and substance use can present with a combination of psy-
chotic and mood symptoms, and thus psychoti c disorder due to another medical condition
needs to be excluded. Distinguishing schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia and
from depressive and bipolar diso rders with psychotic features  is often difficult. Criterion
C is designed to separate schizoaffective di sorder from schizophrenia, and Criterion B is
designed to distinguish schizoaffective diso rder from a depressive or bipolar disorder
with psychotic features. More specifically, schizoaffective disorder can be distinguished
from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psyc hotic features due to the presence of prom-
inent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood
episode. In contrast, in depressive or bipo lar disorders with psychotic features, the psy-
chotic features primarily occur during the mo od episode(s). Because the relative propor-
tion of mood to psychotic symptoms may ch ange over time, the appropriate diagnosis
may change from and to schizoaffective disord er (e.g., a diagnosis of schizoaffective dis-
order for a severe and prominent major depre ssive episode lasting 3 months during the
first 6 months of a persistent psychotic illnes s would be changed to schizophrenia if active
psychotic or prominent residual symptoms pe rsist over several years without a recurrence

Recording Procedures
ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication -induced psychotic disorder begins
with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, de xamethasone) that is presumed to be causing
the delusions or hallucinations. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in
the criteria set, which is based on the drug clas s. For substances that do not fit into any of
the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in
cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of sub-
stance is unknown, the category “u nknown substance” should be used",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,157
"The name of the disorder is followed by the sp ecification of onset (i.e., onset during in-
toxication, onset during with drawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM,
which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single
code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code  is given for the substance use disorder. For
example, in the case of delusio ns occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe co-
caine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.9 cocaine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset
during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also
given. When more than one subs tance is judged to play a significant role in the development
of psychotic symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.9 cannabis-induced psy-
chotic disorder with onset during intoxicati on, with severe cannabis use disorder; 292.9

"Diagnostic Features
The essential features of substance/medicati on-induced psychotic disorder are prominent
delusions and/or hallucinations (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the physiolog-
ical effects of a substance/medication (i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin expo-
sure) (Criterion B). Hallucinations that the individual realizes are substance/medication-
induced are not included here and instead w ould be diagnosed as substance intoxication",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,157

(applies to alcohol withdrawal; cannabis into xication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal; and stimulant intoxication)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,158
"A substance/medication-induced psychotic di sorder is distinguished from a primary
psychotic disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors. For drugs of abuse,
there must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of
substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal . Substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorders arise during or soon after exposure to a medication or after substance intoxica-
tion or withdrawal but can persist for week s, whereas primary psychotic disorders may
precede the onset of substance/ medication use or may occur during times of sustained ab-
stinence. Once initiated, the psychotic symp toms may continue as long as the substance/
medication use continues. Anothe r consideration is the presence  of features that are atyp-
ical of a primary psychotic disord er (e.g., atypical age at onse t or course). For example, the
appearance of delusions de novo in a person older than 35 years without a known history
of a primary psychotic disorder should sugge st the possibility of a substance/medication-
induced psychotic disorder. Even  a prior history of a primary psychotic disorder does not
rule out the possibility of a substance/medicati on-induced psychotic disorder. In contrast,
factors that suggest that the psychotic symp toms are better accounted for by a primary
psychotic disorder include persistence of ps ychotic symptoms for a substantial period of
time (i.e., a month or more) after the end of substance intoxication or acute substance with-
drawal or after cessation of medication use;  or a history of prior recurrent primary psy-
chotic disorders. Other causes of psychoti c symptoms must be considered even in an
individual with substance into xication or withdrawal, because substance use problems are
not uncommon among individuals with non- substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorders. 
In addition to the four symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the
assessment of cognition, depression, and mani a symptom domains is vital for making crit-
ically important distinctions between the va rious schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-
chotic disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,158
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
Psychotic disorders can occur in association wi th intoxication with the following classes of
substances: alcohol; cannabis; hallucinoge ns, including phencyclidine and related sub-
stances; inhalants; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine);
and other (or unknown) substances. Psychotic disorders can occur in association with with-
drawal from the following classes of substanc es: alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxio-
lytics; and other (or unknown) substances. 
Some of the medications reported to evoke psychotic symptoms include anesthetics
and analgesics, anticholinergic agents, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, antihypertensive
and cardiovascular medications, antimicrobial medications, antiparkinsonian medica-
tions, chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cyclosporine, procarbazine), corticosteroids, gastro-
intestinal medications, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inf lammatory medications,
other over-the-counter medicati ons (e.g., phenylephrine, ps eudoephedrine), antidepres-
sant medication, and disulfiram . Toxins reported to induce  psychotic symptoms include
anticholinesterase, organophosphate insectic ides, sarin and other nerve gases, carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide,  and volatile substances such as fuel or paint",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,158
"Prevalence
Prevalence of substance/medi cation-induced psychotic disorder in the general popula-
tion is unknown. Between 7% and 25% of in dividuals presenting with a first episode of
psychosis in different settings are reported  to have substance/medication-induced psy-
chotic disorder. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,158
"114 Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
Development and Course
The initiation of the disorder may vary co nsiderably with the substance. For example,
smoking a high dose of cocaine may produce psychosis within minutes, whereas days or
weeks of high-dose alcohol or sedative use ma y be required to produce psychosis. Alco-
hol-induced psychotic disorder, with hallucina tions, usually occurs only after prolonged,
heavy ingestion of alcohol in individuals who have moderate to severe alcohol use disorder,
and the hallucinations are generally auditory in nature",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,159
"Psychotic disorders induced by amphetamine and cocaine share similar clinical fea-
tures. Persecutory delusions may rapidly develop shortly af ter use of amphetamine or a
similarly acting sympathomimetic. The hallucination of bugs or vermin crawling in or un-
der the skin (formication) can lead to scratchi ng and extensive skin excoriations. Cannabis-
induced psychotic disorder may develop shortl y after high-dose cannabis use and usually
involves persecutory delusions, marked anxiety, emotional lability, and depersonalization",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,159
The disorder usually remits within a day bu t in some cases may persist for a few days,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,159
"Substance/medication-induced psychotic disord er may at times persist when the offend-
ing agent is removed, such that it may be difficult initially to distinguish it from an indepen-
dent psychotic disorder. Agents such as amph etamines, phencyclidine, and cocaine have been
reported to evoke temporary ps ychotic states that can someti mes persist for weeks or longer
despite removal of the agent and treatment with  neuroleptic medication. In later life, poly-
pharmacy for medical conditions and exposure to medications for parkinsonism, cardiovas-
cular disease, and other medi cal disorders may be associated  with a greater likelihood of
psychosis induced by prescription medicati ons as opposed to substances of abuse",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,159

"Functional Consequences of 
Substance/Medication-Indu ced Psychotic Disorder
Substance/medication-induced psychotic diso rder is typically severely disabling and
consequently is observed most frequently in  emergency rooms, as individuals are often
brought to the acute-care setting when it occu rs. However, the disability is typically self-
limited and resolves upon removal of the offending agent",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,159
"Differential Diagnosis
Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal. Individuals intoxicated with stimu-
lants, cannabis, the opioid meperidine, or phe ncyclidine, or those withdrawing from alco-
hol or sedatives, may experience altered percep tions that they recognize as drug effects. If
reality testing for these experiences remains inta ct (i.e., the individual recognizes that the
perception is substance induced and neither believe s in nor acts on it), the diagnosis is not
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Instead, substance intoxication or
substance withdrawal, with perceptual disturbances, is diagnosed (e.g., cocaine intoxica-
tion, with perceptual disturba nces). “Flashback” hallucinations that can occur long after
the use of hallucinogens has stopped are diag nosed as hallucinogen persisting perception
disorder. If substance/medication-induced psychotic symptoms oc cur exclusively during
the course of a delirium, as in severe forms of alcohol withdrawal, the psychotic symptoms
are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed sepa-
rately. Delusions in the context of a major or  mild neurocognitive disorder would be di-
agnosed as major or mild neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,159

medical conditions often take medications fo r those conditions, the clinician must con-
sider the possibility that the psychotic symptoms are caused by the physiological conse-
quences of the medical condition rather than  the medication, in which case psychotic
disorder due to another medical condition is  diagnosed. The hist ory often provides the
primary basis for such a judgme nt. At times, a change in the treatment for the medical con-

pirically for that individual whether the medica tion is the causative agent. If the clinician

"Diagnostic Features
The essential features of psychotic disorder  due to another medical condition are promi-
nent delusions or hallucinations that are judged  to be attributable to the physiological ef-
fects of another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder
(e.g., the symptoms are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical con-
dition, in which case a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder, with ma rked stressor, would
be appropriate). 
Hallucinations can occur in any sensory modalit y (i.e., visual, olfactory, gustatory, tac-
tile, or auditory), but certai n etiological factors are likely to evoke specific hallucinatory
phenomena. Olfactory hallucinations are suggest ive of temporal lobe  epilepsy. Hallucina-
tions may vary from simple and unformed to highly comp lex and organized, depending
on etiological and environmental factors. Ps ychotic disorder due to another medical con-
dition is generally not diagnosed if the individual maintains reality testing for the hallu-
cinations and appreciates that they result from the medical conditio n. Delusions may have
a variety of themes, including somatic, gran diose, religious, and, most commonly, perse-
cutory. On the whole, however, associations  between delusions and particular medical
conditions appear to be less specific  than is the case for hallucinations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,161
"In determining whether the ps ychotic disturbance is attributable to another medical
condition, the presence of a medical condition must be identified and considered to be the
etiology of the psychosis through a physiol ogical mechanism. Although there are no
infallible guidelines for determining whether th e relationship between the psychotic distur-
bance and the medical condition is etiological, several considerations provide some guidance",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,161
"One consideration is the presen ce of a temporal association between the onset, exacerba-
tion, or remission of the medical condition an d that of the psychotic disturbance. A second
consideration is the presence of features that  are atypical for a psychotic disorder (e.g.,
atypical age at onset or presence of visual or  olfactory hallucinations). The disturbance must
also be distinguished from a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or an-
other mental disorder (e.g.,  an adjustment disorder). 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
The temporal association of th e onset or exacerbation of th e medical condition offers the
greatest diagnostic certainty that the delusions  or hallucinations are attributable to a med-
ical condition. Additional factors may incl ude concomitant treatments for the underlying
medical condition that confer a risk for psychosis independently, such as steroid treatment
for autoimmune disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,161
"Prevalence
Prevalence rates for psychotic di sorder due to another medical condition are difficult to es-
timate given the wide variety of underlying medical etiologies. Life time prevalence has",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,161
"Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 117
been estimated to range from 0.21% to 0.54%. When the prevalence findings are stratified
by age group, individuals older than 65 years have a significantly greater prevalence of
0.74% compared with those in younger age grou ps. Rates of psychosis also vary according
to the underlying medical condition; cond itions most commonly  associated with psy-
chosis include untreated endocrine and metabo lic disorders, autoim mune disorders (e.g.,
systemic lupus erythematosus, N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoimmune en-
cephalitis), or temporal lobe epilepsy. Psycho sis due to epilepsy has been further differ-
entiated into ictal, postictal, and interictal  psychosis. The most common of these is postictal
psychosis, observed in 2%–7.8% of epilepsy patients. Among older individuals, there may
be a higher prevalence of the disorder in fe males, although additional gender-related fea-
tures are not clear and vary considerably with  the gender distributions of the underlying
medical conditions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,162
"Development and Course
Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition may be a single transient state or it
may be recurrent, cycling with  exacerbations and remissions of the underlying medical
condition. Although treatment of the underlyi ng medical condition often results in a res-
olution of the psychosis, this is not always  the case, and psychotic symptoms may persist
long after the medical event (e.g ., psychotic disorder due to fo cal brain injury). In the con-
text of chronic conditions such as multiple sc lerosis or chronic interictal psychosis of epi-
lepsy, the psychosis may assume a long-term course",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,162
"The expression of psychotic disorder due to  another medical cond ition does not differ
substantially in phenomenology depending on  age at occurrence. However, older age
groups have a higher prevalence of the disorder, which is most likely due to the increasing
medical burden associated with advanced ag e and the cumulative effects of deleterious
exposures and age-related processes (e.g., athe rosclerosis). The nature of the underlying
medical conditions is likely to change across  the lifespan, with younger age groups more
affected by epilepsy, head trauma, autoimmune , and neoplastic diseas es of early to mid-
life, and older age groups more affected by stroke disease, anoxic events, and multiple sys-
tem comorbidities. Underlying factors with in creasing age, such as preexisting cognitive
impairment as well as vision and hearing impairments, may incur a greater risk for psy-
chosis, possibly by serving to lower th e threshold for experiencing psychosis. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Course modifiers. Identification and treatment of the underlying medical condition has
the greatest impact on course, although pr eexisting central nervou s system injury may

"Diagnostic Markers

"Differential Diagnosis
Delirium. Hallucinations and delusions commonly occur in the context of a delirium;
however, a separate diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is
not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the co urse of a delirium. Delusions
in the context of a major or mild neurocogni tive disorder would be diagnosed as major or
mild neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance. 
Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. If there is evidence of recent or
prolonged substance use (including medicati ons with psychoactive effects), withdrawal
from a substance, or exposure to a toxin (e.g ., LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide] intoxica-
tion, alcohol withdrawal), a substance/medica tion-induced psychotic disorder should be
considered. Symptoms that occur during or shor tly after (i.e., within 4 weeks) of substance
intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be es pecially indicative of a sub-
stance-induced psychotic disorder, depending on the character, duration, or amount of
the substance used. If the clin ician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a
medical condition and substance use, both diag noses (i.e., psychotic disorder due to an-
other medical condition and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder) can be
given",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,163

ders and in depressive or bipolar disorders, wi th psychotic features, no specific and direct
causative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition can be demon-
strated. Late age at onset and the absence of a personal or family history of schizophrenia
or delusional disorder suggest the need for a thorough ass essment to rule out the diagno-
sis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. Auditory hallucinations that
involve voices speaking complex sentences ar e more characteristic of schizophrenia than

"Catatonia is defined by the pres ence of three or more of 12 psychomotor features in the
diagnostic criteria for catatoni a associated with another mental disorder and catatonic dis-
order due to another medical condition. The es sential feature of cata tonia is a marked psy-
chomotor disturbance that may involve decr eased motor activity, decreased engagement
during interview or physical examination, or excessive and peculiar motor activity. The
clinical presentation of ca tatonia can be puzzling, as th e psychomotor disturbance may
range from marked unresponsiveness to marked  agitation. Motoric immobility may be se-
vere (stupor) or moderate (catalepsy and waxy flexibility). Similarly, decreased engage-
ment may be severe (mutism) or moderate  (negativism). Excessive and peculiar motor
behaviors can be complex (e.g.,  stereotypy) or simple (agitation) and may include echola-
lia and echopraxia. In extreme cases, the same individual may wax and wane between de-
creased and excessive motor activity. The se emingly opposing clinical features and
variable manifestations of the diagnosis cont ribute to a lack of awareness and decreased
recognition of catatonia. During  severe stages of catatonia, the individual may need care-
ful supervision to avoid self-h arm or harming others. There are potential risks from mal-

clinical picture is characterized by marked ps ychomotor distur bance and involves at least
three of the 12 diagnostic features listed in Cr iterion A. Catatonia is typically diagnosed in
an inpatient setting and occurs in up to 35% of individuals with schizophrenia, but the ma-
jority of catatonia cases invol ve individuals with depressive  or bipolar disorders. Before
the catatonia specifier is used in neurodevel opmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive, or
other mental disorders, a wide variety of ot her medical conditions need to be ruled out;
these conditions include, but are not limited to, medical cond itions due to infectious, met-
abolic, or neurological conditions (see “Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Con-
dition”). Catatonia can also be a side effect of a medication (see the chapter “Medication-
Induced Movement Disorders and Other Advers e Effects of Medication”). Because of the
seriousness of the complications, particular attention should be paid to the possibility that
the catatonia is attributable to 333.92 (G21.0) neuroleptic malignant syndrome",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,165

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of catato nic disorder due to another me dical condition is the presence
of catatonia that is judged to be attributed to the physiological effects of another medical
condition. Catatonia can be diagnosed by the pres ence of at least three of the 12 clinical fea-
tures in Criterion A. There must be evidence  from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings that the catatonia is attr ibutable to another medical condition (Crite-
rion B). The diagnosis is not given if the ca tatonia is better explained by another mental
disorder (e.g., manic episode) (Criterion C) or if it occurs exclusivel y during the course of
a delirium (Criterion D)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,166
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
A variety of medical conditions may cause catatonia, especially neurological conditions
(e.g., neoplasms, head trauma, cerebrovascular  disease, encephalitis) and metabolic con-
ditions (e.g., hypercalcemia, hepatic encepha lopathy, homocystinuria , diabetic ketoacido-
sis). The associated physical examination find ings, laboratory findings, and patterns of
prevalence and onset reflect those of  the etiological medical condition",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,166
"Differential Diagnosis
A separate diagnosis of catatonic disorder due to another medical condition is not given if
the catatonia occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium or neuroleptic malignant
syndrome. If the individual is currently taking neurolep tic medication, consideration
should be given to medication -induced movement disorders (e.g., abnormal positioning
may be due to neuroleptic-induced acute dy stonia) or neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(e.g., catatonic-like features may be present,  along with associated vital sign and/or labo-
ratory abnormalities). Catatonic symptoms ma y be present in any of the following five
psychotic disorders: brief psychotic disorder , schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorder, and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. It may
also be present in some of the neurodevelopme ntal disorders, in all of the bipolar and de-
pressive disorders,  and in other mental disorders.

"Coding and Recording Procedures
The diagnostic code for bipolar I disorder is based on type of current or most recent epi-
sode and its status with respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features, and
remission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria
are currently met for a manic or major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only
indicated if the full criteria are not current ly met for a manic, hypomanic, or major depres-
sive episode. Codes are as follows:
1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in
grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent
depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is
likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of
grief. These waves tend to be associated with  thoughts or reminder s of the deceased. The
depressed mood of a MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,171
"The pain of grief may be accompanied by positi ve emotions and humor th at are uncharacteristic
of the pervasive unhappiness and misery charac teristic of a major depressive episode. The
thought content associated with grief generally  features a preoccupation with thoughts and
memories of the deceased, rather than the self-c ritical or pessimistic ruminations seen in a MDE",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,171
"In grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in a MDE, feelings of worthlessness and self-
loathing are common. If self-derog atory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves per-
ceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., no t visiting frequently enough, not telling the
deceased how much he or she was loved). If a be reaved individual thinks  about death and dying,
such thoughts are generally focu sed on the deceased and possibl y about “joining” the deceased,
whereas in a major depressive episode such th oughts are focused on ending one’s own life
because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.Bipolar I disorderCurrent or

projects. The projects are often initiated with little knowledge of the topic, and nothing seems
out of the individual’s reach. The increased activity levels may manife st at unusual hours of
the day",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,173
"Inflated self-esteem is typicall y present, ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked
grandiosity, and may reach delusi onal proportions (Criterion B1).  Despite lack of any partic-
ular experience or talent, the individual may embark on comple x tasks such as writing a novel
or seeking publicity for some im practical invention. Grandiose delusions (e.g., of having a
special relationship to a famous person) are co mmon. In children, overe stimation of abilities
and belief that, for example, they are the best at  a sport or the smartest in the class is normal;
however, when such beliefs are present despite cl ear evidence to the contrary or the child at-
tempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important,  represent a change from the
child’s normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied. 
One of the most common features is a decreased need for sleep (Criterion B2) and is
distinct from insomnia in which the individual wants to sleep or feels the need to sleep but
is unable. The individual may sleep little, if at all, or may awaken several hours earlier than
usual, feeling rested and full of energy. When  the sleep disturbance is severe, the individ-
ual may go for days without sleep, yet not feel  tired. Often a decreased need for sleep her-
alds the onset of a manic episode",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,173
"Speech can be rapid, pressured, loud, and diff icult to interrupt (Criterion B3). Individ-
uals may talk continuously and without regard for others’ wi shes to communicate, often
in an intrusive manner or without concern for the relevance of what is said. Speech is
sometimes characterized by jokes, puns, amus ing irrelevancies, and theatricality, with
dramatic mannerisms, singing, and excessive gesturing. Loudness and forcefulness of
speech often become more important than what  is conveyed. If the individual’s mood is
more irritable than expansive, speech may be  marked by complaints, hostile comments, or
angry tirades, particularly if attempts are ma de to interrupt the individual. Both Criterion
A and Criterion B symptoms may be accompanie d by symptoms of the opposite (i.e., de-
pressive) pole (see “with mixed features” specifier, pp. 149–150)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,173
"Often the individual’s thoughts race at a rate faster than they can be expressed through
speech (Criterion B4). Frequently there is flight  of ideas evidenced by a nearly continuous flow
of accelerated speech, with abrupt shifts from one topic to another. When flight of ideas is se-
vere, speech may become disorganized, incoherent , and particularly distressful to the individ-
ual. Sometimes thoughts are experienced as so crowded that it is very difficult to speak",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,173
"Distractibility (Criterion B5) is evidenced by  an inability to censor immaterial external
stimuli (e.g., the interviewer’s attire, backgr ound noises or conversations, furnishings in
the room) and often prevents individuals expe riencing mania from holding a rational con-
versation or attending to instructions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,173
"The increase in goal -directed ac tivity often consists of excessive planning and partici-
pation in multiple activities, including sexual, occupational, political, or religious activi-
ties. Increased sexual drive, fantasies, and be havior are often present. Individuals in a manic
episode usually show increased sociability (e.g ., renewing old acquaintances or calling or
contacting friends or even strangers), without regard to the intrusive, domineering, and
demanding nature of these interactions. They often display psychomotor agitation or rest-
lessness (i.e., purposeless acti vity) by pacing or by holding multiple conversations simulta-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,173

neously. Some individuals write excessive letters , e-mails, text messages, and so forth, on
many different topics to friends,  public figures, or the media. 
The increased activity criterion can be diffic ult to ascertain in children; however, when
the child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic
plans for projects, develops previously abse nt and developmentally inappropriate sexual
preoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure  to sexually explicit mate-
rial), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine
whether the behavior represents a change from the child’s baseline behavior; occurs most
of the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal associa-
tion with other symptoms of mania. 
The expansive mood, excessive optimism, gr andiosity, and poor judgment often lead
to reckless involvement in activities such as spending sprees, giving away possessions,
reckless driving, foolish business investments,  and sexual promiscuity that is unusual for
the individual, even though these activities ar e likely to have catastrophic consequences
(Criterion B7). The individual may purchase  many unneeded items without the money to
pay for them and, in some cases, give them  away. Sexual behavior may include infidelity
or indiscriminate sexual encounters with strangers, often disregarding the risk of sexually
transmitted diseases or in terpersonal consequences",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,174
"The manic episode must result in marked impairment in social or occupational func-
tioning or require hospitalizatio n to prevent harm to self or others (e.g., financial losses, il-
legal activities, loss of employment, self-injur ious behavior). By definition, the presence of
psychotic features during a manic episode also satisfies Criterion C",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,174
"Manic symptoms or syndromes that are attrib utable to the physiological effects of a
drug of abuse (e.g., in the context of cocaine or amphetamine intoxication), the side effects
of medications or treatments (e.g., steroids, L-dopa, antidepressants, stimulants), or an-
other medical condition do not count toward the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. However,
a fully syndromal manic episode that arises duri ng treatment (e.g., with medications, elec-
troconvulsive therapy, light ther apy) or drug use and persists beyond the physiological ef-
fect of the inducing agent (i.e., after a medica tion is fully out of the individual’s system or
the effects of electroconvulsive therapy would be expected to have dissipated completely)
is sufficient evidence for a manic episode di agnosis (Criterion D). Caution is indicated so
that one or two symptoms (particularly increa sed irritability, edginess, or agitation follow-
ing antidepressant use) are not taken as suffi cient for diagnosis of a manic or hypomanic
episode, nor necessarily an indication of a bi polar disorder diathesis. It is necessary to
meet criteria for a manic episode to make a diag nosis of bipolar I disorder, but it is not re-
quired to have hypomanic or major depressi ve episodes. However, they may precede or
follow a manic episode. Full descriptions of the diagnostic features of a hypomanic epi-
sode may be found within the text for bipola r II disorder, and the features of a major de-
pressive episode are described within th e text for major depressive disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,174
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
During a manic episode, individuals often do not perceive that they are ill or in need of treat-
ment and vehemently resist efforts to be treated. Individuals may change their dress, makeup,
or personal appearance to a more sexually su ggestive or flamboyant style. Some perceive a
sharper sense of smell, hearing, or vision. Gambling and antisocial behaviors may accompany
the manic episode. Some individuals may become  hostile and physically threatening to others
and, when delusional, may become physically  assaultive or suicidal. Catastrophic conse-
quences of a manic episode (e.g.,  involuntary hospitalization, difficulties with the law, serious
financial difficulties) often result from poor judgment, loss of insight, and hyperactivity. 
Mood may shift very rapidly to anger or depression. Depressive  symptoms may occur
during a manic episode and, if present, may last moments, hour s, or, more rarely, days (see
“with mixed features” specifier, pp. 149–150).",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,174
"130 Bipolar and Related Disorders
Prevalence
The 12-month prevalence estimate in the contin ental United States was 0.6% for bipolar I
disorder as defined in DSM-IV. Twelve-month prevalence of bipolar I disorder across 11
countries ranged from 0.0% to 0.6%. The life time male-to-female prevalence ratio is ap-
proximately 1.1:1. 
Development and Course
Mean age at onset of the first manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode is approxi-
mately 18 years for bipola r I disorder. Special considerations are necessary to detect the di-
agnosis in children. Since children of the same chronological age may be at different
developmental stages, it is difficult to defi ne with precision what is “normal” or “ex-
pected” at any given point. Therefore, each ch ild should be judged according to his or her
own baseline. Onset occurs throughout the life  cycle, including firs t onsets in the 60s or
70s. Onset of manic symptoms (e.g., sexual or so cial disinhibition) in late mid-life or late-
life should prompt consideratio n of medical conditions (e.g., frontotemporal neurocogni-
tive disorder) and of substance ingestion or withdrawal. 
More than 90% of individuals who have a sin gle manic episode go on to have recurrent
mood episodes. Approximately 60% of manic episodes occur immediately before a major
depressive episode. Individuals with bipolar I disorder who have multiple (four or more)
mood episodes (major depressi ve, manic, or hypomanic) within 1 year receive the speci-
fier “with rapid cycling.” 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Environmental. Bipolar disorder is mo re common in high-income than in low-income
countries (1.4 vs. 0.7%). Separated, divorced,  or widowed individuals have higher rates of
bipolar I disorder than do individuals who ar e married or have neve r been married, but
the direction of the association is unclear. 
Genetic and physiological. A family history of bipolar diso rder is one of the strongest and
most consistent risk factors for bipolar disord ers. There is an average 10-fold increased risk
among adult relatives of individuals with bipo lar I and bipolar II disorders. Magnitude of
risk increases with degree of kinship. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder likely share a ge-
netic origin, reflected in familial co-aggregat ion of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 
Course modifiers. After an individual has a manic episode with psychotic features, subse-
quent manic episodes are more likely to in clude psychotic featur es. Incomplete inter-
episode recovery is more common when th e current episode is accompanied by mood-
incongruent psychotic features",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,175
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Little information exists on specific cultural differences in the expression of bipolar I dis-
order. One possible explanation for this ma y be that diagnostic instruments are often
translated and applied in diff erent cultures with no transcultural validation. In one U.S",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,175
"study, 12-month prevalence of bipolar I diso rder was significantly lower for Afro-Carib-
beans than for African Americans or whites. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Females are more likely to experience rapid cycling and mixed states, and to have patterns of
comorbidity that differ from th ose of males, including higher rates of lifetime eating disor-
ders. Females with bipolar I or II disorder are more likely to experience depressive symptoms
than males. They also have a higher lifetime risk of alcohol use disorder than are males and a
much greater likelihood of alcohol use disorder  than do females in the general population.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,175
"Bipolar I Disorder 131
Suicide Risk
The lifetime risk of suicide in individuals with  bipolar disorder is estimated to be at least
15 times that of the general population. In fa ct, bipolar disorder may account for one-quar-
ter of all completed su icides. A past history of suicide attempt and percent days spent de-
pressed in the past year are associated with gr eater risk of suicide attempts or completions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,176
"Functional Consequences of Bipolar I Disorder
Although many individuals with bipolar disord er return to a fully functional level be-
tween episodes, approximately 30%  show severe impairment in  work role function. Func-
tional recovery lags substantially behind reco very from symptoms, especially with respect
to occupational recovery, resulting in lower socioeconomic status despite equivalent lev-
els of education when compared with the ge neral population. Individuals with bipolar I
disorder perform more poorly than healthy in dividuals on cognitive tests. Cognitive im-
pairments may contribute to vocational and interpersonal difficulties and persist through
the lifespan, even during euthymic periods",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,176
"Differential Diagnosis
Major depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder may also be accompanied by hy-
pomanic or manic symptoms (i.e., fewer symptoms or for a shorter duration than required
for mania or hypomania). When the individual presents in an episode of major depression,
one must depend on corroborating history re garding past episodes of mania or hypoma-
nia. Symptoms of irritability may be associated with either major depressive disorder or
bipolar disorder, adding to  diagnostic complexity",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,176
"Other bipolar disorders. Diagnosis of bipolar I disorder is differentiated from bipolar II
disorder by determining whether there have be en any past episodes of mania. Other spec-
ified and unspecified bipolar and related disord ers should be differentiated from bipolar I
and II disorders by considering whether eith er the episodes invol ving manic or hypo-
manic symptoms or the episodes of depressive symptoms fail  to meet the full criteria for
those conditions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,176

"Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder, or other
anxiety disorders. These disorders need to be consider ed in the differential diagnosis as
either the primary disorder or, in some case s, a comorbid disorder. A careful history of
symptoms is needed to  differentiate generalized anxiety disorder from bipolar disorder,
as anxious ruminations may be mistaken for ra cing thoughts, and efforts to minimize anx-
ious feelings may be taken as impulsive beha vior. Similarly, sympto ms of posttraumatic
stress disorder need to be differentiated from bipolar disorder. It is helpful to assess the ep-

1In distinguishing grief from a major  depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in grief
the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness an d loss, while in a MDE it is persistent depressed
mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or  pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to
decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These
waves tend to be associated with thoughts or re minders of the deceased. The depressed mood of a
MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations. The pain of grief may
be accompanied by positive emotions and humor th at are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhap-
piness and misery characteristic of a MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally fea-
tures a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or
pessimistic ruminations seen in a MDE. In grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in a
MDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing ar e common. If self-derogatory ideation is present
in grief, it typically involves pe rceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently
enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks
about death and dying, such thoughts are genera lly focused on the deceased and possibly about
“'joining” the deceased, whereas in a MDE such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life

Diagnostic Features
Bipolar II disorder is characterized by a clin ical course of recurr ing mood episodes con-
sisting of one or more majo r depressive episodes (Criteria A–C under “Major Depressive
Episode”) and at least one hypomanic epis ode (Criteria A–F under “Hypomanic Epi-
sode”). The major depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks, and the hypomanic epi-
sode must last at least 4 days, to meet the di agnostic criteria. During the mood episode(s),
the requisite number of symptoms  must be present most of th e day, nearly every day, and
represent a noticeable change from usual behavior and functioning. The presence of a
manic episode during the course of illness pr ecludes the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder
(Criterion B under “Bipolar II Disorder”). Episodes of substance/medication-induced de-
pressive disorder or substance/medication-i nduced bipolar and related disorder (repre-
senting the physiological effects of a medicati on, other somatic treatments for depression,
drugs of abuse, or toxin exposure) or of de pressive and related disorder due to another
medical condition or bipolar and related disord er due to another medi cal condition do not
count toward a diagnosis of bi polar II disorder unless they persist beyond the physiolog-
ical effects of the treatment or substance and then meet duration criteria for an episode. In
addition, the episodes must not be better acco unted for by schizoaffective disorder and are
not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or
other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders (Cri-
terion C under “Bipolar II Disorder”). The de pressive episodes or hypomanic fluctuations
must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning (Criterion D under “Bipolar II Disorder ”); however, for hy-
pomanic episodes, this requirement does not have to be met. A hypomanic episode that
causes significant impairment would likely qu alify for the diagnosis of manic episode and,
therefore, for a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. The recurrent major depressive ep-
isodes are often more frequent and lengthier than those occurring in bipolar I disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,180
"Individuals with bipolar II d isorder typically present to a clinician during a major de-
pressive episode and are unlikely to complain  initially of hypomania. Typically, the hy-
pomanic episodes themselves do not cause im pairment. Instead, th e impairment results
from the major depressive episodes or from a persistent pattern of unpredictable mood
changes and fluctuating, unreliable interperso nal or occupational functioning. Individu-
als with bipolar II disorder may not view the hypomanic episodes as pathological or dis-
advantageous, although others may be troubled by the indi vidual’s erratic behavior",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,180

"136 Bipolar and Related Disorders
A hypomanic episode should not be confused wi th the several days of euthymia and re-
stored energy or activity that may follow remiss ion of a major depressive  episode. Despite the
substantial differences in duration and severi ty between a manic and hypomanic episode, bi-
polar II disorder is not a “milder form” of bipo lar I disorder. Compared with individuals with
bipolar I disorder, individuals with bipolar II di sorder have greater chronicity of illness and
spend, on average, more time in the depressive phase of their illness, which can be severe and/
or disabling. Depressive symptoms co-occurr ing with a hypomanic episode or hypomanic
symptoms co-occurring with a depressive episod e are common in individuals with bipolar II
disorder and are overrepresented in females, pa rticularly hypomania with mixed features. In-
dividuals experiencing hypomania with mixed fe atures may not label their symptoms as hy-
pomania, but instead experience them as depr ession with increased energy or irritability",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,181
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
A common feature of bipolar II disorder is impulsivity, which can contribute to suicide at-
tempts and substance use disorders. Impulsivit y may also stem from a concurrent person-
ality disorder, substance use disorder, anxiet y disorder, another mental disorder, or a
medical condition. There may be heightened levels of creativity in some individuals with
a bipolar disorder. However, that relationship  may be nonlinear; th at is, greater lifetime
creative accomplishments have been associated  with milder forms of  bipolar disorder, and
higher creativity has been f ound in unaffected family members. The individual’s attach-
ment to heightened creativity during hypomanic episodes may contribute to ambivalence
about seeking treatment or undermine adherence to treatment. 
Prevalence
The 12-month prevalence of bipolar II disord er, internationally, is  0.3%. In the United
States, 12-month prevalence is 0.8%. The prevalence rate of pediatric bipolar II disorder is
difficult to establish. DSM-IV bipolar I, bipola r II, and bipolar disorder not otherwise spec-
ified yield a combined prevalence rate of 1. 8% in U.S. and non-U.S. community samples,
with higher rates (2.7% inclusive) in youths age 12 years or older. 
Development and Course
Although bipolar II disorder can begin in late adolescence and throughout adulthood, av-
erage age at onset is the mid-20s, which is slight ly later than for bipolar I disorder but ear-
lier than for major depressive  disorder. The illness most of ten begins with a depressive
episode and is not recognized as bipolar II d isorder until a hypomanic episode occurs; this
happens in about 12% of individuals with the initial diagnosis of major depressive disor-
der. Anxiety, substance use, or eating diso rders may also precede the diagnosis, compli-
cating its detection. Many individuals expe rience several episodes of major depression
prior to the first recognized hypomanic episode. 
The number of lifetime episodes (both hypomanic and major depressive episodes)
tends to be higher for bipolar II disorder than for major depressive disorder or bipolar I
disorder. However, individuals with bipolar I disorder are actually more likely to experi-
ence hypomanic symptoms than  are individuals with bipolar II disorder.The interval
between mood episodes in the co urse of bipolar II disorder tends to decrease as the indi-
vidual ages. While the hypomanic episode is the feature that defines bipolar II disorder,
depressive episodes are more enduring and disabling over time. Despite the predomi-
nance of depression, once a hypomanic epis ode has occurred, the diagnosis becomes bi-
polar II disorder and never reve rts to major depressive disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,181
"Approximately 5%–15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder ha ve multiple (four or
more) mood episodes (hypomanic or major depressive) within the previous 12 months. If",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,181
"Bipolar II Disorder 137
this pattern is present, it is noted by the specifier “with rapid cycling.” By definition, psy-
chotic symptoms do not occur in hypomanic episodes, and they appear to be less frequent
in the major depressive episodes in bipolar II di sorder than in those of bipolar I disorder. 
Switching from a depressive episode to a manic or hypomanic episode (with or with-
out mixed features) may occur, both spontane ously and during treatment for depression",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,182
"About 5%–15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder will ultimately develop a manic ep-
isode, which changes the diagnosis to bipolar I disorder, regardless of  subsequent course. 
Making the diagnosis in children is often a challenge, especially in those with irritabil-
ity and hyperarousal that is nonepisodic  (i.e., lacks the well-demarcated periods of altered
mood). Nonepisodic irritability in  youth is associated with an elevated risk for anxiety dis-
orders and major depressive disorder, but not bipolar disorder, in ad ulthood. Persistently
irritable youths have lower familial rates of bipolar disorder than do  youths who have bi-
polar disorder. For a hypomanic episode to be  diagnosed, the child’s symptoms must ex-
ceed what is expected in a given environment and culture for the child’s developmental
stage. Compared with adult onset of bipolar II disorder, childhood or  adolescent onset of
the disorder may be associated with a more severe lifetime course. The 3-year incidence
rate of first-onset bipolar II disorder in adults older than 60 years is 0.34%. However, dis-
tinguishing individuals older than 60 years with bipolar II disorder by late versus early
age at onset does not appear to have any clinical utility",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,182
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. The risk of bipolar II disorder  tends to be highest among rel-
atives of individuals with bipolar II disorder, as opposed to individuals with bipolar I dis-
order or major depressive disorder. There ma y be genetic factors influencing the age at
onset for bipolar disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,182
"Course modifiers. A rapid-cycling pattern is associated  with a poorer prognosis. Return
to previous level of social fu nction for individuals with bipolar II disorder is more likely
for individuals of younger age and with less severe depression, sugge sting adverse effects
of prolonged illness on recovery. More education, fewer ye ars of illness, and being mar-
ried are independently associated with functi onal recovery in individuals with bipolar
disorder, even after diagnostic  type (I vs. II), current depressive symptoms, and presence
of psychiatric comorbidity are taken into account",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,182
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Whereas the gender ratio for bipolar I disorder is equal, findings on gender differences in
bipolar II disorder are mixed, differing by type of sample (i.e., registry, community, or
clinical) and country of origin. There is little to  no evidence of bipolar gender differences,
whereas some, but not all, clinical samples su ggest that bipolar II disorder is more com-
mon in females than in males, which may refl ect gender differences in treatment seeking
or other factors. 
Patterns of illness and comorbidity, however,  seem to differ by gender, with females
being more likely than males to report hypomania with mixed depressive features and a
rapid-cycling course. Childbirth may be a spec ific trigger for a hypomanic episode, which
can occur in 10%–20% of females in nonclinical populations and most typically in the early
postpartum period. Distinguishing hypomani a from the elated mood and reduced sleep
that normally accompany the birth of a chil d may be challenging. Postpartum hypomania
may foreshadow the onset of a depression that occurs in abou t half of females who expe-
rience postpartum “highs.” Accurate detectio n of bipolar II disorder may help in estab-
lishing appropriate treatment of the depression , which may reduce the risk of suicide and
infanticide. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,182
"138 Bipolar and Related Disorders
Suicide Risk
Suicide risk is high in bipolar II disorder. Approximately one-third of individuals with bi-
polar II disorder report a lifetime history of suicide attempt. The prev alence rates of life-
time attempted suicide in bipolar II and bipola r I disorder appear to be similar (32.4% and
36.3%, respectively). However, the lethality of attempts, as defined by a lower ratio of at-
tempts to completed suicides, may be higher in individuals with bipolar II disorder com-
pared with individuals with bipolar I disorder. There may be an association between
genetic markers and increased risk for suicidal behavior in individuals with bipolar dis-
order, including a 6.5-fold higher risk of su icide among first-degree relatives of bipolar II
probands compared with those with bipolar I disorder. 
Functional Consequences  of Bipolar II Disorder
Although many in dividuals with bipolar II disorder return to a fully functional level be-
tween mood episodes, at least 15% continue to have some in ter-episode dysfunction, and
20% transition directly into another mood episode without inter-ep isode recovery. Func-
tional recovery lags substantially behind recovery from symptoms of bipolar II disorder,
especially in regard to occupational recovery , resulting in lower socioeconomic status de-
spite equivalent levels of education with the general population. Individuals with bipolar
II disorder perform more  poorly than healthy individuals on cognitive tests and, with the
exception of memory and semantic fluency, ha ve similar cognitive impairment as do in-
dividuals with bipolar I disord er. Cognitive impairments associ ated with bipolar II disor-
der may contribute to vocational difficulti es. Prolonged unemployment in individuals
with bipolar disorder is associated with more episodes of depression, older age, increased
rates of current panic disorder, and lif etime history of alcohol use disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,183
"Differential Diagnosis 
Major depressive disorder. Perhaps the most challenging differential diagnosis to con-
sider is major depressive di sorder, which may be accompanied by hypomanic or manic
symptoms that do not meet full criteria (i.e., either fewer symptoms or a shorter duration
than required for a hypomanic episode). This is  especially true in evaluating individuals
with symptoms of irritability, which may be associated with either  major depressive dis-
order or bipolar II disorder. 
Cyclothymic disorder. In cyclothymic disorder, there are numerous periods of hypo-
manic symptoms and numerous periods of depr essive symptoms that do not meet symp-
tom or duration criteria for a major depressive  episode. Bipolar II disorder is distinguished
from cyclothymic disorder by the presence of  one or more major depressive episodes. If a
major depressive episode occurs after the firs t 2 years of cyclothymic disorder, the addi-
tional diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is given",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,183
"Schizophrenia spectrum and other related psychotic disorders. Bipolar II disorder must
be distinguished from psychotic disorders (e .g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,
and delusional disorder). Sc hizophrenia, schizoaffective di sorder, and delusional disor-
der are all characterized by periods of psychotic symptoms that occur in the absence of
prominent mood symptoms. Other helpful considerations incl ude the accompanying
symptoms, previous cour se, and family history",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,183

nosis.

"Cyclothymic Disorder 139
symptoms of ADHD, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, and less need
for sleep, overlap with the symp toms of hypomania. The double  counting of symptoms to-
ward both ADHD and bipolar II disorder can be avoided if the clinician clarifies whether
the symptoms represent a distin ct episode and if the noticeab le increase over baseline re-
quired for the diagnosis of bipo lar II disorder is present. 
Personality disorders. The same convention as applies for ADHD also applies when
evaluating an individual for a personality disorder such as borderline personality disor-
der, since mood lability and impulsivity are common in both personality disorders and bi-
polar II disorder. Symptoms must represent a di stinct episode, and the noticeable increase
over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipo lar II disorder must be present. A diagnosis
of a personality disorder should not be made during an untreated mood episode unless
the lifetime history supports the pr esence of a personality disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,184
"Other bipolar disorders. Diagnosis of bipolar II disorder should be differentiated from
bipolar I disorder by carefully considering whether there have been any past episodes of
mania and from other specified and unspecifie d bipolar and related disorders by confirm-
ing the presence of fully synd romal hypomania and depression",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,184
"Comorbidity
Bipolar II disorder is more often than not associated with one or more co-occurring mental
disorders, with anxiety disorders being the most common. Approximately 60% of individ-
uals with bipolar II disorder  have three or more co-occurr ing mental disorders; 75% have
an anxiety disorder; and 37% have a substa nce use disorder. Children and adolescents
with bipolar II disorder have a higher rate  of co-occurring anxiety disorders compared
with those with bipolar I diso rder, and the anxiety disorder most often predates the bi-
polar disorder. Anxiety and substance use diso rders occur in individuals with bipolar II
disorder at a higher rate than in the genera l population. Approximately 14% of individuals
with bipolar II disorder have at least one lif etime eating disorder, with binge-eating dis-
order being more common than bulim ia nervosa and anorexia nervosa",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,184
"These commonly co-occurring disorders do no t seem to follow a course of illness that
is truly independent from that of the bipolar disorder, but rather have strong associations
with mood states. For example, anxiety and ea ting disorders tend to associate most with
depressive symptoms, and substance use disord ers are moderately associated with manic
symptoms.

Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of cyclot hymic disorder is a chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance
involving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symp-
toms that are distinct from each other (Criterion A). The hypomanic symptoms are of
insufficient number, severity, pervasiveness, or  duration to meet full criteria for a hypo-
manic episode, and the depressive symptoms ar e of insufficient nu mber, severity, perva-
siveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a major depressive episode. During the initial
2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents), the symptoms must be persistent (pres-
ent more days than not), and any symptom-fr ee intervals last no longer than 2 months
(Criterion B). The diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is made only if the criteria for a major
depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode  have never been met (Criterion C)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,185
"If an individual with cyclothymic disorder su bsequently (i.e., after the initial 2 years in
adults or 1 year in children or adolescents) experiences a major depressive, manic, or hy-
pomanic episode, the diagnosis changes to majo r depressive disorder , bipolar I disorder,
or other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder (subclassified as hypomanic
episode without prior major depressive episod e), respectively, and the cyclothymic disor-
der diagnosis is dropped",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,185
"The cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is not made  if the pattern of mood swings is better
explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delu-
sional disorder, or other specified and un specified schizophrenia spectrum and other
psychotic disorders (Criterion D), in which c ase the mood symptoms are considered asso-
ciated features of the psychoti c disorder. The mood disturbanc e must also not be attribut-
able to the physiological effe cts of a substance (e.g., a dr ug of abuse, a medication) or
another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidis m) (Criterion E). Although some individ-
uals may function particularly  well during some of the pe riods of hypomania, over the
prolonged course of the disorder , there must be clinically significant distress or impair-
ment in social, occupational, or other import ant areas of functioning as a result of the
mood disturbance (Criterion F). The impairment may develop as a result of prolonged pe-

"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. Major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II
disorder are more common among first-degree bi ological relatives of individuals with cyclo-

biological relatives of individuals with bipolar I disorder than in the general population. 
Differential Diagnosis
Bipolar and related disorder due to anothe r medical condition and depressive disorder
due to another medical condition. The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to
another medical condition or depressive disorder due to another medical condition is
made when the mood disturbance is judged to be attributable to the physiological effect of
a specific, usually chronic medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). This determination
is based on the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. If it is judged that the
hypomanic and depressive symptoms are not the physiological consequence of the med-
ical condition, then the primary mental disorder (i.e., cyclothymi c disorder) and the med-
ical condition are coded. For example, this would be the case if the mood symptoms are
considered to be the psychological (not the physiological) consequence of having a chronic
medical condition, or if there is no etiological relationship between the hypomanic and de-
pressive symptoms and the medical condition",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,186

ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication -induced bipolar and related disor-

be causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diag nostic code is selected from the table in-
cluded in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit
into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethason e), the code for “other substance” should be

"144 Bipolar and Related Disorders
bipolar and related disorder, foll owed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during in-
toxication, onset during withdrawal). For exam ple, in the case of irritable symptoms oc-
curring during intoxica tion in a man with a severe coca ine use disorder, the diagnosis is
F14.24 severe cocaine use disorder with co caine-induced bipolar and related disorder,
with onset during intoxication . A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use
disorder is not given. If the substance-induce d bipolar and related disorder occurs without
a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., afte r a one-time heavy use of the substance), no
accompanying substance use disorder is note d (e.g., F15.94 amphetamine-induced bipolar
and related disorder, with onset during into xication). When more than one substance is
judged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each
should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder with meth-
ylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19.94
dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related di sorder, with onset during intoxication)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,189
"Diagnostic Features
The diagnostic features of substance/medication -induced bipolar and related disorder are es-
sentially the same as those for mania, hypomania, or depression . A key exception to the diag-
nosis of substance/medication-induced bipolar an d related disorder is the case of hypomania
or mania that occurs after antidepressant medi cation use or other treatments and persists be-
yond the physiological effects of the medication. This condition is considered an indicator of
true bipolar disorder, not substance/medication -induced bipolar and re lated disorder. Simi-
larly, individuals with apparent electroconvulsive therapy–induced manic or hypomanic ep-
isodes that persist beyond th e physiological effects of the treatment are diagnosed with
bipolar disorder, not substance/medication -induced bipolar and related disorder. 
Side effects of some antidepressants and ot her psychotropic drugs (e.g., edginess, ag-
itation) may resemble the primary symptoms  of a manic syndrome, but they are funda-
mentally distinct from bipolar symptoms and are insufficient for the diagnosis. That is, the
criterion symptoms of mania/hypomania have specificity (simple agitation is not the same
as excess involvement in purposeful activiti es), and a sufficient number of symptoms
must be present (not just one or two symptoms ) to make these diagnoses. In particular, the
appearance of one or two nons pecific symptoms—irri tability, edginess, or agitation during
antidepressant treatment—in the absence of  a full manic or hypomanic syndrome should
not be taken to support a diagnosis of a bipolar disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,189
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Etiology (causally related to the use of psychotropic medications or substances of abuse
based on best clinical evidence) is the key variab le in this etiologically specified form of bi-
polar disorder. Substances/medications that are typically considered to be associated
with substance/medication-induced bipolar and related diso rder include the stimulant
class of drugs, as well as phencyclidine and steroids; however, a numb er of potential sub-
stances continue to emerge as new compounds are synthesized (e.g., so-calle d bath salts)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,189
A history of such substance use may help increase diagnostic certainty,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,189
"Prevalence
There are no epidemiological studies of substance/medication-induced mania or bipolar
disorder. Each etiological substance may have its own individual risk of inducing a bipo-
lar (manic/hypomanic) disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,189
"Development and Course
In phencyclidine-induced mania, the initial pres entation may be one of a delirium with af-
fective features, which then becomes an atyp ically appearing manic or mixed manic state.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,189
"Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 145
This condition follows the ingestion or inhalati on quickly, usually within hours or, at the
most, a few days. In stimulant-induced manic or  hypomanic states, the response is in min-
utes to 1 hour after one or several ingestions  or injections. The episode is very brief and
typically resolves over 1–2 days. With co rticosteroids and some immunosuppressant
medications, the mania (or mixed or depressed state) usually follows several days of in-
gestion, and the higher doses appear to have a much greate r likelihood of producing bi-
polar symptoms. 
Diagnostic Markers
Determination of the substance of use can be made through markers in the blood or urine
to corroborate diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,190
"Differential Diagnosis
Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder should be differentiated
from other bipolar disorders, substance into xication or substance-induced delirium, and
medication side effects (as noted earlier). A full manic episode that emerges during anti-
depressant treatment (e.g., medication, electr oconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully
syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for
a bipolar I diagnosis. A full hypomanic episode  that emerges during antidepressant treat-
ment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therap y) but persists at a fully syndromal level
beyond the physiological effect of that treatme nt is sufficient evidence for a bipolar II di-
agnosis only if preceded by a major depressive episode",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,190
"Comorbidity
Comorbidities are those associated with the use of illicit substances (in the case of illegal
stimulants or phencyclidine) or diversion of prescribed stimulants. Comorbidities related
to steroid or immunosuppre ssant medications are those medical indications for these
preparations. Delirium can occur before or along with manic symptoms in individuals in-
gesting phencyclidine or those who are prescr ibed steroid medications or other immuno-
suppressant medications",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,190

"Diagnostic Features
The essential features of bipolar and related disorder due to anothe r medical condition are
presence of a prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irri-
table mood and abnormally increased activity or energy predominating in the clinical pic-
ture that is attributable to another medical condition (Criterion B). In most cases the manic
or hypomanic picture may appear during the in itial presentation of the medical condition
(i.e., within 1 month); howeve r, there are exceptions, especi ally in chronic medical condi-
tions that might worsen or relapse and herald  the appearance of the manic or hypomanic
picture. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition would not be diag-
nosed when the manic or hypomanic episodes definitely preceded the medical condition,
since the proper diagnosis would be bipolar disorder (except in the unusual circumstance
in which all preceding manic or hypomanic episodes—or, when only one such episode has
occurred, the preceding manic or hypomanic episode—were associated with ingestion of
a substance/medication). The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another
medical condition should not be made during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The
manic or hypomanic episode in  bipolar and related disorder due to another medical con-
dition must cause clinically significant dist ress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other important areas of fu nctioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion E)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,191
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Etiology (i.e., a causal relationship to anothe r medical condition based on best clinical ev-
idence) is the key variable in this etiologically  specified form of bipolar disorder. The list-
ing of medical conditions that are said to be able to induce mania is never complete, and
the clinician’s best judgment is the essence of  this diagnosis. Among the best known of the
medical conditions that can cause a bipolar manic or hypomanic co ndition are Cushing’s
disease and multiple sclerosis, as well as stroke and traumatic brain injuries. 
Development and Course 
Bipolar and related disorder due to another me dical condition usually has its onset acutely
or subacutely within the firs t weeks or month of the onset of the associated medical con-
dition. However, this is not always the case, as a worsening or later relapse of the associ-
ated medical condition may precede the onset of the manic or hypomanic syndrome. The
clinician must make a clinical judgment in these situations about whether the medical con-
dition is causative, based on temporal sequence  as well as plausibility of a causal relation-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,191
"Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 147
ship. Finally, the condition may remit before or just after the medi cal condition remits,
particularly when treatment of the ma nic/hypomanic symptoms is effective. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Culture-related differences, to the extent that  there is any evidence, pertain to those asso-
ciated with the medical condition (e.g., rates of multiple sclerosis and stroke vary around
the world based on dietary, genetic fact ors, and other environmental factors)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,192
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Gender differences pertain to those associat ed with the medical condition (e.g., systemic
lupus erythematosus is more common in fema les; stroke is somewhat more common in
middle-age males compared with females)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,192
"Diagnostic Markers
Diagnostic markers pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e.g., steroid
levels in blood or urine to help corroborate the diagnosis of Cushing’s disease, which can
be associated with manic or depressive synd romes; laboratory test s confirming the diag-
nosis of multiple sclerosis)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,192
"Functional Consequences of Bipolar and Related 
Disorder Due to Anot her Medical Condition
Functional consequences of the bipolar sy mptoms may exacerbate impairments associ-
ated with the medical condit ion and may incur worse outcom es due to interference with
medical treatment. In general, it is believed, but not established, that the illness, when in-
duced by Cushing’s disease, will not recur if the Cushing’s disease is cured or arrested",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,192
"However, it is also suggested, but not establ ished, that mood syndromes, including de-
pressive and manic/hypomanic ones, may be episod ic (i.e., recurring) with static brain in-
juries and other central nervous system diseases",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,192
"Differential Diagnosis
Symptoms of delirium, catatonia, and acute anxiety. It is important to differentiate
symptoms of mania from excite d or hypervigilant delirious symptoms; from excited cata-
tonic symptoms; and from agitation related to acute anxiety states. 
Medication-induced depre ssive or manic symptoms. An important differential diag-
nostic observation is that the other medica l condition may be treated with medications
(e.g., steroids or alpha-interferon) that can induce depressive or manic symptoms. In these
cases, clinical judgment using all of the eviden ce in hand is the best way to try to separate
the most likely and/or the most important of two etiological factors (i.e., association with
the medical condition vs. a substance/medicati on-induced syndrome). The differential di-
agnosis of the associated medical conditions is relevant but largely beyond the scope of the
present manual.

tinct quality” of mood that is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” speci-
fier is experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic

"155Depressive
Disorders
Depressive disorders  include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, major
depressive disorder (including  major depressive episode), persistent depressive disorder
(dysthymia), premenstrual dysphoric disord er, substance/medication-induced depres-
sive disorder, depressive disord er due to another medical co ndition, other specified de-
pressive disorder, and unspec ified depressive disorder. Unlike in DSM-IV, this chapter
“Depressive Disorders” has been separated fr om the previous chapter “Bipolar and Re-
lated Disorders.” The common feature of all of these disorders is the presence of sad,
empty, or irritable mood, accompanied by somatic and cognitive changes that signifi-
cantly affect the individual’s capacity to function. What differs among them are issues of
duration, timing, or presumed etiology. 
In order to address concerns about the pote ntial for the overdiagnosis of and treatment
for bipolar disorder in children, a new diagno sis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder,
referring to the presentation of children wi th persistent irritability and frequent episodes
of extreme behavioral dyscontrol, is added to the depressive disorders for children up to
12 years of age. Its placement in this chapter reflects the finding that children with this
symptom pattern typica lly develop unipolar depressive disorders or anxiety disorders,
rather than bipolar disorders, as they  mature into adolescence and adulthood",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,200
"Major depressive disorder represents the clas sic condition in this gr oup of disorders. It
is characterized by discrete episodes of at least 2 weeks’ duration (although most episodes
last considerably longer) involving clear-cut changes in affect, cogn ition, and neurovege-
tative functions and inter-episode remissions.  A diagnosis based on a single episode is
possible, although the disorder is a recurrent one in the majori ty of cases. Careful consid-
eration is given to the delineation of normal sadness and grief from a major depressive ep-
isode. Bereavement may induce great suffering, but it does not typically induce an episode
of major depressive disorder. When they do occur together, the depressive symptoms and
functional impairment tend to be more seve re and the prognosis is worse compared with
bereavement that is not accompanied by majo r depressive disorder. Bereavement-related
depression tends to occur in persons with other vulnerabilities to depressive disorders,
and recovery may be facilitated by antidepressant treatment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,200

"Diagnostic Features
The core feature of disruptive mood dysregulat ion disorder is chronic, severe persistent ir-
ritability. This severe irritability has two prominent clinical mani festations, the first of
which is frequent temper outbursts. These ou tbursts typically occur in response to frus-
tration and can be verbal or behavioral (the la tter in the form of aggression against prop-
erty, self, or others). They must occur frequent ly (i.e., on average, three or more times per
week) (Criterion C) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria E and F), such as in
the home and at school, and th ey must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,201
"The second manifestation of severe irritability consists of chronic, persistently irritable or
angry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry
mood must be characteristic of the child, bein g present most of the day, nearly every day,
and noticeable by others in the child’s environment (Criterion D). ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,201
"Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder 157
The clinical presentation of disruptive mo od dysregulation disord er must be carefully
distinguished from presentations of other, re lated conditions, particularly pediatric bi-
polar disorder. In fact, disruptive mood dy sregulation disorder was added to DSM-5 to
address the considerable concern about the appropriate classification and treatment of
children who present with chronic, persistent irritability relative to children who present
with classic (i.e., episo dic) bipolar disorder. 
Some researchers view severe, non-episodic ir ritability as characteristic of bipolar dis-
order in children, although both DSM-IV and DSM-5 require that both children and adults
have distinct episodes of mania or hypomania to qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar I dis-
order. During the latter decades of the 20th century, this contention by researchers that
severe, nonepisodic irritability is a manifestat ion of pediatric mania coincided with an up-
surge in the rates at which clinicians assigned the diagnosis of bipolar disorder to their
pediatric patients. This sharp increase in rates appears to be attributab le to clinicians com-
bining at least two clinical presentations into a single category. That is, both classic, epi-
sodic presentations of mania and non-episodic  presentations of severe irritability have
been labeled as bipolar disorder in children. In DSM-5, the term bipolar disorder  is explicitly
reserved for episodic presentations of bipolar symptoms. DSM-IV did not include a diagno-
sis designed to capture youths whose hallmar k symptoms consisted of very severe, non-
episodic irritability, whereas DSM-5, with the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder, provides a distinct ca tegory for such presentations. 
Prevalence
Disruptive mood dysregulatio n disorder is common among children presenting to pedi-
atric mental health clinics. Prevalence estima tes of the disorder in the community are un-
clear. Based on rates of chronic and severe pe rsistent irritability, which is the core feature
of the disorder, the overall 6-month to 1-year period-prevale nce of disruptive mood dys-
regulation disorder among children and adolescents probably falls in the 2%–5% range",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,202
"However, rates are expected to be higher in males and school-age children than in females
and adolescents. 
Development and Course
The onset of disruptive mood dysregulation diso rder must be before age 10 years, and the
diagnosis should not be applied to children with a developmental age of less than 6 years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,202
"It is unknown whether the condition presents only in this age-delimited fashion. Because
the symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulat ion disorder are likely to change as children
mature, use of the diagnosis shou ld be restricted to age grou ps similar to those in which
validity has been established (7–18 years). A pproximately half of children with severe,
chronic irritability will have a presentation that  continues to meet crit eria for the condition
1 year later. Rates of conversion from seve re, nonepisodic irritability to bipolar disorder
are very low. Instead, children with chronic irritability are at risk to develop unipolar de-
pressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood. 
Age-related variations also differentiate cl assic bipolar disorder  and disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder. Rates of bipolar disorder generally are very low prior to adoles-
cence (<1%), with a steady increase into early adulthood (1%–2% prevalence). Disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder is more common th an bipolar disorder prior to adolescence,
and symptoms of the condition generally be come less common as children transition into
adulthood. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Children with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psy-
chiatric histories. In such children, a relati vely extensive history of chronic irritability is",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,202

common, typically manifesting be fore full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such predi-
agnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,203
"Many children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have symptoms that also
meet criteria for atte ntion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD) and for an anxiety dis-
order, with such diagnoses often being presen t from a relatively early age. For some chil-
dren, the criteria for major depres sive disorder may also be met. 
Genetic and physiological. In terms of familial aggregat ion and genetics, it has been
suggested that children presenting with chronic, non-episodic irritability can be differen-
tiated from children with bipolar disorder in  their family-based risk. However, these two
groups do not differ in familial rates of anxi ety disorders, unipolar  depressive disorders,
or substance abuse. Compared with children with pediatric bipolar disorder or other men-
tal illnesses, those with disruptive mood dy sregulation disorder exhibit both commonal-
ities and differences in information-proce ssing deficits. For example, face-emotion
labeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision  making and cognitive control, are present in
children with bipolar disorder and chronica lly irritable children, as well as in children
with some other psychiatric conditions. There is also evidence for disorder-specific dys-
function, such as during tasks assessing atte ntion deployment in response to emotional
stimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic ir-
ritability. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Children presenting to clinics with features of  disruptive mood dysr egulation disorder are
predominantly male. Among co mmunity samples, a male pr eponderance appears to be
supported. This difference in prevalence betw een males and females differentiates disrup-
tive mood dysregulation disord er from bipolar disorder, in which there is an equal gender
prevalence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,203
"Suicide Risk
In general, evidence documenting suicidal be havior and aggression, as well as other se-
vere functional consequences, in disruptive mood dysregulation diso rder should be noted
when evaluating children with chronic irritability. 
Functional Consequences of 
Disruptive Mood Dy sregulation Disorder
Chronic, severe irritability, su ch as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is
associated with marked disruption in a child’ s family and peer relationships, as well as in
school performance. Because of their extrem ely low frustration tole rance, such children
generally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the
activities typically enjoyed by healthy children;  their family life is severely disrupted by
their outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,203
"Levels of dysfunction in childr en with bipolar disorder and disruptive mood  dysregulation
disorder are generally comparable. Both condit ions cause severe disruption in the lives of
the affected individual and their families. In  both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
and pediatric bipolar disorder, dangerous behavi or, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts,
severe aggression, and psychiatric hospitalization are common",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,203

ries, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysreg ulation disorder must be made while consid-
ering the presence or absence of multiple ot her conditions. Despite the need to consider",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,203
"Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder 159
many other syndromes, differentiation of disr uptive mood dysregulation disorder from bi-
polar disorder and oppositional  defiant disorder requires pa rticularly careful assessment. 
Bipolar disorders. The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disor-
der and bipolar disorders in children involves the longitudinal course of the core symptoms. In
children, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipo lar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness
with discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child’s typical
presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs  during a manic episode is distinctly different
from the child’s usual mood. In addition, during a manic episode, the change in mood must be
accompanied by the onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical
symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-dir ected activity), which are also present to a de-
gree that is distinctly different from the child’s  usual baseline. Thus, in the case of a manic ep-
isode, parents (and, depending on  developmental level, children) should be able to identify a
distinct time period during which the child’s  mood and behavior were markedly different
from usual. In contrast, the irritability of disr uptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent
and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irri-
tability is characteristic of the child with disr uptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, while
bipolar disorders are episodic conditions, disrup tive mood dysregulation disorder is not. In
fact, the diagnosis of di sruptive mood dysregulation disorder  cannot be assi gned to a child
who has ever experienced a full-duration hypoma nic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric)
or who has ever had a manic or hypomanic epis ode lasting more than 1 day. Another central
differentiating feature between bipolar disorder s and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common
features of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive mood dy sregulation disorder. 
Oppositional defiant disorder. While symptoms of opposition al defiant disorder typi-
cally do occur in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, mood symptoms
of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder ar e relatively rare in children with opposi-
tional defiant disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder in children whose sympto ms also meet criteria  for oppositional de-
fiant disorder are the presence of severe an d frequently recurrent outbursts and a persis-
tent disruption in mood betw een outbursts. In addition, the diagnosis of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder requires severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home,
school, or among peers) and mild  to moderate impairment in a second setting. For this rea-
son, while most children whose symptoms meet  criteria for disrup tive mood dysregula-
tion disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria fo r oppositional defiant
disorder, the reverse is not the case. That is, in only approximately 15% of individuals with
oppositional defiant disorder would criteria  for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
be met. Moreover, even for child ren in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the
diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Finally, both the
prominent mood symptoms in disruptive mood  dysregulation disorder and the high risk
for depressive and anxiety disorders in follow -up studies justify placement of disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder among the depr essive disorders in DSM-5. (Oppositional
defiant disorder is included in the chapter “Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct
Disorders.”) This reflects the more prominent mood comp onent among individuals with
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional
defiant disorder. Nevertheless, it  also should be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder appears to carry a high risk for be havioral pr oblems as well as mood problems",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,204
"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ma jor depressive disorder, anxiety disorders,
and autism spectrum disorder. Unlike children diagnosed with bipolar disorder or op-
positional defiant disorder, a child whose sy mptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder also can receive a co morbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive
disorder, and/or anxiety disorder. However, children whose irritability is present only in
the context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,204
"160 Depressive Disorders
should receive one of those di agnoses rather than disrupti ve mood dysregulation disor-
der. Children with disruptive mood dysregul ation disorder may have symptoms that also
meet criteria for an anxiety disorder and can receive both diagnoses, but children whose ir-
ritability is manifest only in the context of exacerbation of an anxiety disorder should re-
ceive the relevant anxiety disorder diagnosis rather than disruptive  mood dysregulation
disorder. In addition, children  with autism spectrum diso rders frequently present with
temper outbursts when, for example, their rout ines are disturbed. In that instance, the
temper outbursts would be considered secondary to the au tism spectrum disorder, and
the child should not receive the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. 
Intermittent explosive disorder. Children with symptoms su ggestive of intermittent
explosive disorder present with instances of severe temper outburst s, much like children
with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. However, unlike disruptive mood dysreg-
ulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not re quire persistent disruption in
mood between outbursts. In addition, intermittent explosive disorder requires only 3 months
of active symptoms, in contrast to the 12- month requirement for disruptive mood dys-
regulation disorder. Thus, these two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For
children with outbursts and intercurrent, persis tent irritability, only the diagnosis of dis-
ruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. 
Comorbidity
Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysr egulation disorder are extremely high. It is
rare to find individuals whose symptoms meet  criteria for disrupti ve mood dysregulation
disorder alone. Comorbidity between disrupti ve mood dysregulatio n disorder and other
DSM-defined syndromes appears higher than for many other pediatric mental illnesses;
the strongest overlap is with oppositional de fiant disorder. Not only  is the overall rate of
comorbidity high in disruptive mood dysregul ation disorder, but also the range of comor-
bid illnesses appears particularly diverse. These children typically present to the clinic
with a wide range of disruptive behavior , mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum
symptoms and diagnoses. Howe ver, children with disruptive  mood dysregulation disor-
der should not have symptoms that meet criter ia for bipolar disorder, as in that context,
only the bipolar disorder di agnosis should be made. If children have symptoms that meet
criteria for oppositional defiant disorder or intermittent explosive disorder and disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disor-
der should be assigned. Also, as noted earlier, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregu-
lation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxiety-
provoking context, when the routines of a ch ild with autism spectrum disorder or obses-
sive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of  a major depressive episode",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,205

"1In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in
grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent
depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is
likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of
grief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The
depressed mood of MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,206
"The pain of grief may be accompanied by positi ve emotions and humor th at are uncharacteristic
of the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of MDE. The thought content associated
with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased,
rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminati ons seen in MDE. In grief, self-esteem is gener-
ally preserved, whereas in MDE feelings of wort hlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-
derogatory ideation is present in grief, it ty pically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the
deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, no t telling the deceased how much he or she was
loved). If a bereaved individual thinks abou t death and dying, such thoughts are generally
focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the de ceased, whereas in MDE such
thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life,
or unable to cope with the pain of depression.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,206

Diagnostic Features 
The criterion symptoms for majo r depressive disorder must be  present nearly every day to
be considered present, with the exception of  weight change and suicidal ideation. De-
pressed mood must be present for most of the day, in addition to being present nearly ev-
ery day. Often insomnia or fatigue is the presenting complaint, and failure to probe for
accompanying depressive symptoms will result in underdiagnosis. Sadness may be de-
nied at first but may be elicit ed through interview or inferred from facial expression and
demeanor. With individuals wh o focus on a somatic complaint, clinicians should de-
termine whether the distress from that comp laint is associated with specific depressive
symptoms. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high propor tion of cases; psy-
chomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall sever-
ity, as is the presence of delu sional or near-delusional guilt.Severity/course specifier Single episode Recurrent episode*

"Major Depressive Disorder 163
The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least 2 weeks during
which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activi-
ties (Criterion A). In children and adolescents,  the mood may be irritable rather than sad",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,208
"The individual must also expe rience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list
that includes changes in appetite or weigh t, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased en-
ergy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking, co ncentrating, or making deci-
sions; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicid al ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To
count toward a major depressive episode, a sy mptom must either be newly present or must
have clearly worsened compared with the person’s pre- episode status. The symptoms
must persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The ep-
isode must be accompanied by clinically signif icant distress or impairment in social, occu-
pational, or other important areas of func tioning. For some in dividuals with milder
episodes, functioning may appear  to be normal but requires markedly increased effort",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,208
"The mood in a major depressive episode is of ten described by the person as depressed,
sad, hopeless, discouraged, or “down in the du mps” (Criterion A1). In some cases, sadness
may be denied at first but may subsequently be  elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out
that the individual looks as if he or she is ab out to cry). In some individuals who complain
of feeling “blah,” having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood
can be inferred from the pers on’s facial expression and de meanor. Some individuals em-
phasize somatic complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of
sadness. Many individuals report or exhibit in creased irritability (e.g.,  persistent anger, a
tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming ot hers, an exaggerated
sense of frustration over minor matters). In ch ildren and adolescents, an irritable or cranky
mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presenta tion should be dif-
ferentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,208
"Loss of interest or pleasure is nearly always  present, at least to some degree. Individ-
uals may report feeling less interested in hobb ies, “not caring anymore,” or not feeling any
enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family
members often notice social withdrawal or ne glect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a for-
merly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to
practice). In some individuals,  there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sex-
ual interest or desire",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,208
"Appetite change may involve either a redu ction or increase. Some depressed individ-
uals report that they have to force themselv es to eat. Others may eat more and may crave
specific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in
either direction), there may be a significant loss  or gain in weight, or , in children, a failure
to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,208

terminal insomnia (i.e., waking too early and be ing unable to return to sleep). Initial in-
somnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may al so occur. Individuals who present with over-

"The sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may in-
clude unrealistic negative evaluations of one’ s worth or guilty preoccupations or rumina-
tions over minor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individu als often misinterpret neutral
or trivial day-to-day events as  evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense
of responsibility for untoward events. The sens e of worthlessness or guilt may be of delu-
sional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced that he or she is personally re-
sponsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet
occupational or interpersonal responsibilities as  a result of the depression is very common
and, unless delusional, is not consider ed sufficient to meet this criterion",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,209

decisions (Criterion A8). They may appear ea sily distracted or complain of memory diffi-

uals, memory difficulties may be the chief co mplaint and may be mistaken for early signs
of a dementia (“pseudodementia”). When th e major depressive ep isode is successfully
treated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particu-

"Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Cri terion A9) are common",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,209
"They may range from a passive wish not to aw aken in the morning or a belief that others
would be better off if the individual were dead , to transient but recurrent thoughts of com-
mitting suicide, to a specific suicide plan. Mo re severely suicidal individuals may have put
their affairs in order (e.g., up dated wills, settled debts), acqu ired needed materials (e.g., a
rope or a gun), and chosen a location and time  to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for
suicide may include a desire to give up in th e face of perceived insurmountable obstacles,
an intense wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emo-
tional state, an inability to fo resee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not be a burden to
others. The resolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful measure of diminished
suicide risk than denial of further plans for suicide",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,209
"The evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult
when they occur in an indivi dual who also has a general me dical condition (e.g., cancer,
stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, pregna ncy). Some of the criterion signs and symp-
toms of a major depressive episode are iden tical to those of general medical conditions
(e.g., weight loss with untreated diabetes; fatigue with cancer; hypersomnia early in preg-
nancy; insomnia later in pregnancy or the postpartum). Such symp toms count toward a
major depressive diagnosis except when they are clearly and fully attributable to a general
medical condition. Nonv egetative symptoms of dysphoria,  anhedonia, guilt or worthless-
ness, impaired concentration or indecision, an d suicidal thoughts should be assessed with
particular care in such cases. Definitions of  major depressive episodes that have been mod-

"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
Major depressive disorder is a ssociated with high mortality,  much of which is accounted
for by suicide; however, it is not the only cause. For example, depressed individuals ad-
mitted to nursing homes have a markedly increased likelihood of death in the first year. In-
dividuals frequently present with tearfulness,  irritability, brooding , obsessive rumination,
anxiety, phobias, excessive worry over physical he alth, and complaints of pain (e.g., head-
aches; joint, abdominal, or other pains). In children, separation anxiety may occur. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,209
"Major Depressive Disorder 165
Although an extensive literature exists de scribing neuroanatomi cal, neuroendocrino-
logical, and neurophysiological correlates of major depressive disord er, no laboratory test
has yielded results of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as a diagnostic tool for
this disorder. Until recently, hypothalamic-pit uitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity had been
the most extensively investigated abnormalit y associated with major depressive episodes,
and it appears to be associated with melancho lia, psychotic features, and risks for eventual
suicide. Molecular studies have also implicated peripheral factors, including genetic vari-
ants in neurotrophic factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. A dditionally, functional
magnetic resonance imaging stud ies provide evidence  for functional ab normalities in spe-
cific neural systems supporting emotion processing, reward seeking, and emotion regula-
tion in adults with major depression. 
Prevalence
Twelve-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the United States is approximately
7%, with marked differences by age group such th at the prevalence in 18- to 29-year-old indi-
viduals is threefold higher than the prevalence in individuals age 60 years or older. Females ex-
perience 1.5- to 3-fold higher rates th an males beginning in early adolescence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,210
"Development and Course
Major depressive disorder may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of onset in-
creases markedly with puberty. In the United States, incidence appears to peak in the 20s;
however, first onset in la te life is not uncommon. 
The course of major depressive  disorder is quite variable, such that some individuals
rarely, if ever, experience re mission (a period of 2 or more  months with no symptoms, or
only one or two symptoms to no more than a mild degree), while others experience many
years with few or no symptoms  between discrete episodes. It  is important to distinguish
individuals who present for treatment during an exacerbation of a chronic depressive ill-
ness from those whose symptoms developed recently. Chronicity of depressive symptoms
substantially increases the likelihood of underlying personality, anxiety, and substance
use disorders and decreases the likelihood that  treatment will be followed by full symp-
tom resolution. It is therefore useful to ask individuals presenting with depressive symp-
toms to identify the last period  of at least 2 months during wh ich they were entirely free of
depressive symptoms. 
Recovery typically begins within 3 months of onset for two in five individuals with ma-
jor depression and within 1 year for four in five individuals. Recency of onset is a strong
determinant of the likelihood of near-term recovery, and many individuals who have been
depressed only for several months can be expe cted to recover sponta neously. Features as-
sociated with lower recovery rates, other th an current episode duration, include psychotic
features, prominent anxiety, persona lity disorders, and symptom severity",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,210
"The risk of recurrence become s progessively lower over time as the duration of re-
mission increases. The risk is higher in in dividuals whose preceding episode was severe,
in younger individuals, and in individuals who have already experienced multiple epi-
sodes. The persistence of even  mild depressive symptoms du ring remission is a powerful
predictor of recurrence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,210
"Many bipolar illnesses begin with one or mo re depressive episodes, and a substantial
proportion of individuals who initially appear to have ma jor depressive disorder will
prove, in time, to instead have a bipolar disorder. This is more likely in individuals with
onset of the illness in adolescence, those with psychotic features, and those with a family
history of bipolar illness. The presence of a “with mixed feat ures” specifier also increases
the risk for future manic or hypomanic diagnosis. Major depr essive disorder, particularly
with psychotic features, may al so transition into schizophre nia, a change that is much
more frequent than the reverse. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,210
"166 Depressive Disorders
Despite consistent differences between gender s in prevalence rates for depressive disor-
ders, there appear to be no clear differences by gender in phenomenology, course, or treat-
ment response. Similarly, there are no clear effe cts of current age on the course or treatment
response of major depressive disorder. Some symptom differe nces exist, though, such that
hypersomnia and hyperphagia ar e more likely in younger individuals, and melancholic
symptoms, particularly psychomotor disturbances, are more common in older individuals",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,211
"The likelihood of suicide attempts lessens in mi ddle and late life, although the risk of com-
pleted suicide does not. Depressions with ea rlier ages at onset are more familial and more
likely to involve personality disturbances. The course of major depressive disorder within
individuals does not generally change with aging. Mean times to recovery appear to be sta-
ble over long periods, and the likelihood of be ing in an episode does not generally increase
or decrease with time. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. Neuroticism (negative affectivity) is a well-established risk factor for the
onset of major depressive disorder, and high le vels appear to render individuals more likely
to develop depressive episodes in re sponse to stressful life events",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,211
"Environmental. Adverse childhood experiences, part icularly when there are multiple
experiences of diverse types, constitute a set of  potent risk factors for major depressive dis-
order. Stressful life events are well recognized  as precipitants of major depressive epi-
sodes, but the presence or absence of adverse life events near the onset of episodes does
not appear to provide a useful guide to prognosis or treatment selection",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,211
"Genetic and physiological. First-degree family members of individuals with major de-
pressive disorder have a risk for major depres sive disorder two- to  fourfold higher than
that of the general population. Relative risks appear to be higher for early-onset and re-
current forms. Heritability is a pproximately 40%, and the personality trait neuroticism ac-
counts for a substantial port ion of this genetic liability",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,211
"Course modifiers. Essentially all major nonm ood disorders increase the risk of an indi-
vidual developing depression. Major depressive episodes th at develop against the back-
ground of another disorder of ten follow a more refractory course. Substance use, anxiety,
and borderline personality diso rders are among the most common of these, and the pre-
senting depressive symptoms may obscure an d delay their recognition. However, sus-
tained clinical improvement in depressive  symptoms may depend on the appropriate
treatment of underlying illnesses. Chronic or  disabling medical conditions also increase
risks for major depressive episod es. Such prevalent illnesses as diabetes, morbid obesity,
and cardiovascular disease are often complicated by depressive episodes, and these epi-
sodes are more likely to become chronic than are depressive episodes in medically healthy
individuals",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,211
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Surveys of major depressive disorder across diverse cultures have shown sevenfold dif-
ferences in 12-month prevalen ce rates but much more consistency in female-to-male ratio,
mean ages at onset, and the degree to which presence of the disorder raises the likelihood
of comorbid substance abuse. While these findings suggest substantial cultural differences
in the expression of major depressive disord er, they do not permit simple linkages be-
tween particular cultures and the likelihoo d of specific symptoms. Rather, clinicians
should be aware that in most  countries the majority of cases of depression go unrecog-
nized in primary care settings and that in ma ny cultures, somatic sy mptoms are very likely
to constitute the presenting  complaint. Among the Criterion A symptoms, insomnia and
loss of energy are the most uniformly reported.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,211
"Major Depressive Disorder 167
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Although the most reproducible finding in th e epidemiology of major depressive disorder
has been a higher prevalence in females, th ere are no clear differences between genders in
symptoms, course, treatment response, or functional consequences. In women, the risk for
suicide attempts is higher, and the risk for suicide completion is lower. The disparity in
suicide rate by gender is not as great among th ose with depressive disorders as it is in the
population as a whole. 
Suicide Risk
The possibility of suicidal behavior exists at  all times during major depressive episodes",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,212
"The most consistently described risk factor is a past history of suicide attempts or threats,
but it should be remembered that most comp leted suicides are not preceded by unsuccess-
ful attempts. Other features associated with  an increased risk for completed suicide
include male sex, being single or living alone,  and having prominent feelings of hopeless-
ness. The presence of borderline personality disorder markedly increases risk for future
suicide attempts. 
Functional Consequences of 
Major Depressive Disorder
Many of the functional consequences of major depressive disorder derive from individual
symptoms. Impairment can be very mild, such th at many of those who interact with the af-
fected individual are unaware of depressive symptoms. Impairment may, however, range
to complete incapacity such that the depressed individual is unable to attend to basic self-
care needs or is mute or catatonic. Among individuals seen in ge neral medical settings,
those with major depressive disorder have more pain and physical illness and greater de-
creases in physical, social, and role functioning",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,212
"Differential Diagnosis

nosed in addition to the mood  disorder. However, the clinic ian must be cautious not to

Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is a depressed mood
that occurs for most of the day, for more days th an not, for at least 2 ye ars, or at least 1 year
for children and adolescents (Criterion A). Th is disorder represents a consolidation of
DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive di sorder and dysthymic disorder. Major de-
pression may precede persistent depressive disorder, and major de pressive episodes may
occur during persistent depressive disorder. Individuals whose symptoms meet major de-
pressive disorder criter ia for 2 years should be given a diagnosis of persistent depressive
disorder as well as majo r depressive disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,214
"Individuals with persistent depressive diso rder describe their mood as sad or “down
in the dumps.” During periods of depressed mood, at least two of the six symptoms from
Criterion B are present. Because these sympto ms have become a part of the individual’s
day-to-day experience, particular ly in the case of early onse t (e.g., “I’ve always been this",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,214

way”), they may not be reported unless the indi vidual is directly prom pted. During the 2-year
period (1 year for children or adolescents), any symptom-free intervals last no longer than
2 months (Criterion C). 
Prevalence
Persistent depressive disorder is effectively an amalgam of DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and
chronic major depressive episode. The 12-month prevalence in the United States is approxi-
mately 0.5% for persistent depre ssive disorder and 1.5% for chro nic major depressive disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,215
"Development and Course
Persistent depressive disorder often has an early and insidious onset (i.e., in childhood,
adolescence, or early adult life) and, by de finition, a chronic course. Among individuals
with both persistent depressiv e disorder and borderline pers onality disorder, the covari-
ance of the corresponding features over ti me suggests the operatio n of a common mecha-
nism. Early onset (i.e., before age 21 years)  is associated with a higher likelihood of
comorbid personality disorder s and substance use disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,215
"When symptoms rise to the level of a major depressive episode, they are likely to sub-
sequently revert to a lower level. However,  depressive symptoms are much less likely to
resolve in a given period of time in the context of persistent depressive disorder than they
are in a major depressive episode",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,215
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. Factors predictive of poorer long -term outcome include higher levels
of neuroticism (negative affect ivity), greater symptom severity, poorer global functioning,
and presence of anxiety disorders or conduct disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,215
"Genetic and physiological. There are no clear differences in  illness development, course,
or family history between DSM-IV dysthymi c disorder and chronic major depressive dis-
order. Earlier findings pertaining to either disorder are therefore likely to apply to per-
sistent depressive disorder. It is thus likel y that individuals with persistent depressive
disorder will have a higher pr oportion of first-degree relatives with persistent depressive
disorder than do individuals with major de pressive disorder, and more depressive disor-
ders in general",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,215
"A number of brain regions (e.g., prefrontal  cortex, anterior cing ulate, amygdala, hip-
pocampus) have been implicated in persiste nt depressive disorder. Possible polysomno-
graphic abnormalities exist as well",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,215
"Functional Consequences of 
Persistent Depressive Disorder
The degree to which persistent depressive diso rder impacts social and occupational func-
tioning is likely to vary widely, but effects can be as great as or greater than those of major
depressive disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,215
"Differential Diagnosis
Major depressive disorder. If there is a depressed mood plus two or more symptoms
meeting criteria for a persistent depressive ep isode for 2 years or more, then the diagnosis of
persistent depressive disorder is made. Th e diagnosis depends on the 2-year duration,
which distinguishes it from episodes of depressi on that do not last 2 years. If the symptom",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,215

criteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any time during this pe-
riod, then the diagnosis of major depression shou ld be noted, but it is coded not as a separate
diagnosis but rather as a specifie r with the diagnosis of  persistent depressive disorder. If the
individual’s symptoms currently meet full crit eria for a major depressive episode, then the
specifier of “with intermittent major depressi ve episodes, with current episode” would be
made. If the major depressive episode has pers isted for at least a 2-year duration and re-
mains present, then the specifie r “with persistent major depressive episode” is used. When
full major depressive episode cr iteria are not currently met but there has been at least one
previous episode of major depression in the cont ext of at least 2 years of persistent depres-
sive symptoms, then the specifier of “with in termittent major depres sive episodes, without
current episode” is used. If the individual ha s not experienced an episode of major depres-
sion in the last 2 years, then the specifier “with pure dysthymic syndrome” is used",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,216
"Psychotic disorders. Depressive symptoms are a common  associated feature of chronic
psychotic disorders (e.g., schi zoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder). A
separate diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is not made if the symptoms occur
only during the course of the psychoti c disorder (including residual phases)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,216
"Depressive or bipolar and related diso rder due to another medical condition. Persistent
depressive disorder must be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar and related dis-
order due to another medical co ndition. The diagnosis is depressive or bipolar and related
disorder due to another medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged, based on his-
tory, physical examination, or laboratory findin gs, to be attributable to the direct patho-
physiological effects of a specific, usually  chronic, medical condition (e.g., multiple
sclerosis). If it is judged that the depressive  symptoms are not attrib utable to the physiolog-
ical effects of another medical condition, then the primary ment al disorder (e.g., persistent
depressive disorder) is recorded, and the medi cal condition is noted as a concomitant med-
ical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,216
"Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder. A substance/medi-
cation-induced depressive or bipolar and rela ted disorder is distin guished from persis-
tent depressive disorder when a substance (e.g ., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) is
judged to be etiologically re lated to the mood disturbance",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,216

least two symptomatic cycles",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,218
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Delusions and hallucinations have been described in the late luteal phase of the menstrual
cycle but are rare. The premenstrual phase has b een considered by some to be a risk period
for suicide. 
Prevalence
Twelve-month prevalence of premenstrual dy sphoric disorder is between 1.8% and 5.8%
of menstruating women. Estimates are substant ially inflated if they are based on retro-
spective reports rather than prospective da ily ratings. However,  estimated prevalence
based on a daily record of symptoms for 1–2 months may be less representative, as indi-
viduals with the most severe symptoms may be  unable to sustain the rating process. The
most rigorous estimate of premenstrual dy sphoric disorder is 1.8% for women whose
symptoms meet the full criteria without fu nctional impairment and 1.3% for women
whose symptoms meet the current criteria wi th functional impairment and without co-oc-
curring symptoms from another mental disorder. 
Development and Course
Onset of premenstrual dysphoric disorder ca n occur at any point after menarche. Inci-
dence of new cases over a 40-month follow-up period is 2.5% (95% confidence interval =
1.7–3.7). Anecdotally, many individuals, as th ey approach menopause, report that symp-
toms worsen. Symptoms cease after menopaus e, although cyclical hormone replacement
can trigger the re-expression of symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,218
"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Environmental. Environmental factors associated with the expression of premenstrual
dysphoric disorder include stress, history of  interpersonal trauma, seasonal changes, and
sociocultural aspects of female sexual behavior  in general, and female gender role in par-
ticular. 
Genetic and physiological. Heritability of prem enstrual dysphoric disorder is unknown",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,218
"However, for premenstrual sy mptoms, estimates for heritability range between 30% and
80%, with the most stable component of premenstrual symptoms es timated to be about
50% heritable. 
Course modifiers. Women who use oral contraceptiv es may have fewer premenstrual
complaints than do women who do not use oral contraceptives. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Premenstrual dysphoric disord er is not a culture-bound syndrome and has been observed
in individuals in the United States, Europe, India, and Asia. It is unclear as to whether rates
differ by race. Nevertheless, fr equency, intensity, and expres sivity of symptoms and help-
seeking patterns may be significantl y influenced by cultural factors. 
Diagnostic Markers
As indicated earlier, the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is appropriately
confirmed by 2 months of pros pective symptom ratings. A number of scales, including the",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,218

self-report and an observer vers ion, both of which have been validated and used widely to
measure illness severity in women who ha ve premenstrual dysphoric disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,219
"Functional Consequences of 
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder
Symptoms must be associated with clinically  meaningful distress and/or an obvious and
marked impairment in the ability to function so cially or occupationally in the week prior
to menses. Impairment in social functionin g may be manifested by marital discord and
problems with children, other family members,  or friends. Chronic marital or job prob-
lems should not be confused with dysfunction that occurs only in association with pre-
menstrual dysphoric disorder. 
Differential Diagnosis
Premenstrual syndrome. Premenstrual syndrome differs from premenstrual dysphoric
disorder in that a minimum of five symptoms is not required, and there is no stipulation of
affective symptoms for individuals who have premenstrual syndrome. This condition
may be more common than premenstrual dy sphoric disorder, although the estimated
prevalence of premenstrual syndrome varies. While premen strual syndrome shares the
feature of symptom expression during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, it is
generally considered to be less severe than  premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The pres-
ence of physical or  behavioral symptoms in the pr emenstruum, without the required
affective symptoms, likely meet s criteria for prem enstrual syndrome and not for premen-
strual dysphoric disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,219
"Dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is a syndrome of painful menses, but this is distinct from a
syndrome characterized by affective changes.  Moreover, symptoms of dysmenorrhea begin
with the onset of menses, whereas symptoms of  premenstrual dysphoric disorder, by defini-
tion, begin before the onset of menses, even if they linger into the first few days of menses. 
Bipolar disorder, major depressive disord er, and persistent depressive disorder
(dysthymia). Many women with (either naturally occurring or substance/medication-
induced) bipolar or major depressive disorder  or persistent depressive disorder believe
that they have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. However, when they chart symptoms,
they realize that the symptoms do not follo w a premenstrual pattern. Women with an-
other mental disorder may experience chronic symptoms or interm ittent symptoms that
are unrelated to menstrual cycle phase. Howeve r, because the onset of menses constitutes
a memorable event, they may report that symptoms occur only during the premenstruum
or that symptoms worsen premenstrually. This  is one of the rationales for the requirement
that symptoms be confirmed by daily prospect ive ratings. The process of differential di-
agnosis, particularly if the clinician relies on retrospective symptoms only, is made more
difficult because of the overlap between sy mptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder
and some other diagnoses. The overlap of symp toms is particularly salient for differenti-
ating premenstrual dysphoric disorder from major depressive episodes, persistent de-
pressive disorder, bipolar disorders, and bo rderline personality di sorder. However, the
rate of personality disorders is no higher in individuals with premenstrual dysphoric dis-
order than in those without the disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,219

menstrual symptoms may be using hormonal treatments, including hormonal contracep-
tives. If such symptoms occur after initia tion of exogenous hormone use, the symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,219

may be due to the use of hormones rather th an to the underlying condition of premen-
strual dysphoric disorder. If the woman stops hormones and the symptoms disappear,
this is consistent with substance/medi cation-induced depressive disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,220
"Comorbidity
A major depressive episode is the most frequent ly reported previous disorder in individuals
presenting with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A wide range of medical (e.g., migraine,
asthma, allergies, seizure disorders) or other mental disorders (e.g., depressive and bipolar
disorders, anxiety disorders, bulimia nervosa, substance use disorders) may worsen in the
premenstrual phase; however, the absence of  a symptom-free period during the postmen-
strual interval obviates a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These conditions
are better considered premenstrual  exacerbation of a current mental or medical disorder. Al-
though the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder should not be assigned in situa-
tions in which an individual only experien ces a premenstrual exacerbation of another
mental or physical disorder, it can be considered in addition to the diagnosis of another men-
tal or physical disorder if the individual experiences symptoms and changes in level of func-
tioning that are characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and markedly different
from the symptoms experienced as part of the ongoing disorder.

"C. The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that is not substance/
medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent depressive disorder could in-
clude the following:
The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms
persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute
withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence
of an independent non-substance/medication-i nduced depressive disorder (e.g., a his-
tory of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,220

the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-
induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record
“mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced depressive disorder (e.g.,
“mild cocaine use di sorder with cocain e-induced depressive disorder”). If a moderate or se-
vere substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder,
the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use

a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced depressive disorder,
with onset during with drawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use dis-
order is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in

"ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication -induced depressive disorder begins
with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, de xamethasone) that is presumed to be causing
the depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the
criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid sub-
stance use disorder. For substances that do no t fit into any of the cl asses (e.g., dexameth-
asone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is
judged to be an etiological factor but the spec ific class of substance is unknown, the category
“unknown substance” should be used",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,222
"When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is
listed first, followed by the word “with,” follo wed by the name of the substance-induced de-
pressive disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset
during withdrawal). For example,  in the case of depressive sy mptoms occurring during with-
drawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine use
disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate
diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced
depressive disorder occurs without a comorbid  substance use disorder  (e.g., after a one-time
heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.94
phencyclidine-induced depr essive disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than
one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive mood
symptoms, each should be listed separately (e .g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder

"Diagnostic Features
The diagnostic features of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder include the
symptoms of a depressive disorder, such as major depressive disorder; however, the de-
pressive symptoms are associated with the ingestion, injection, or inhalation of a sub-
stance (e.g., drug of abuse,  toxin, psychotropic medicati on, other medication), and the
depressive symptoms persist be yond the expected length of physiological effects, intoxi-
cation, or withdrawal period. As evidenced by  clinical history, phy sical examination, or
laboratory findings, th e relevant depressive disorder should have developed during or
within 1 month after use of a substance that is capable of producing the depressive disor-
der (Criterion B1). In additi on, the diagnosis is not better  explained by an independent
depressive disorder. Evidence of an indepe ndent depressive disorder includes the de-
pressive disorder preceded the onset of inge stion or withdrawal from the substance; the
depressive disorder persists beyo nd a substantial period of ti me after the cessation of sub-
stance use; or other evidence suggests th e existence of an independent non-substance/
medication-induced depressive disorder (Criterion C). This diagnosis should not be made
when symptoms occur exclusivel y during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The de-
pressive disorder associated with the substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal must
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa tional, or other impor-
tant areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion E)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,222

can induce depressive mood di sturbances. Clinical judgment is essential to determine
whether the medication is truly associated with inducing the depressive disorder or
whether a primary depressive disorder happen ed to have its onset while the person was
receiving the treatment. For example, a depres sive episode that developed within the first
several weeks of beginning alpha-methyldopa (an antihypertensive agent) in an individ-
ual with no history of major depressive diso rder would qualify for the diagnosis of med-
ication-induced depressive diso rder. In some cases, a prev iously established condition
(e.g., major depressive disorder , recurrent) can recur while th e individual is coincidentally
taking a medication that has the capacity  to cause depressive symptoms (e.g., L-dopa, oral
contraceptives). In such cases, the clinicia n must make a judgment  as to whether the med-
ication is causative in this particular situation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,223
"A substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from a primary
depressive disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors associated with the
substance use. There must be evidence from the history, phy sical examination, or labora-
tory findings of substance use, abuse, intoxication, or withdrawal prior to the onset of the
depressive disorder. The withdrawal state for some substances can be relatively pro-
tracted, and thus intense depressive symptoms can last for a long period after the cessation
of substance use. 
Prevalence
In a nationally representative U.S. adult po pulation, the lifetime pr evalence of substance/
medication-induced depressive disorder is 0.26%",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,223
"Development and Course
A depressive disorder associated with the use of substance (i.e., alcoho l, illicit drugs, or a
prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition) must have its on-
set while the individual is using the substanc e or during withdrawal, if there is a with-
drawal syndrome associated with the substanc e. Most often, the de pressive disorder has
its onset within the first few weeks or 1 month of use of the substance. Once the substance
is discontinued, the depressive symptoms usually  remit within days to several weeks, de-
pending on the half-life of the substance/medication and the presence of a withdrawal
syndrome. If symptoms persist 4 weeks beyond the expected time course of withdrawal of
a particular substance/medi cation, other causes for th e depressive mood symptoms
should be considered",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,223
"Although there are a few prospective controlle d trials examining the association of de-
pressive symptoms with use of a medication, most report s are from postmarketing sur-
veillance studies, retrospective observational studies, or case  reports, making evidence of
causality difficult to determine. Substances implicated in medication-induced depressive
disorder, with varying degrees of evidence, in clude antiviral agents (efavirenz), cardio-
vascular agents (clonidine, guanethidine, me thyldopa, reserpine), re tinoic acid deriva-
tives (isotretinoin), antidepressants, antico nvulsants, anti-migraine agents (triptans),
antipsychotics, hormonal agents (corticost eroids, oral contrace ptives, gonadotropin-
releasing hormone agonists, tamoxifen), smoking cessation agents (varenicline), and im-
munological agents (interferon) . However, other potential su bstances continue to emerge
as new compounds are synthesized. A history of  such substance use may help increase di-
agnostic certainty",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,223

ever, in age-stratified analyses , the risk for patients ages 18–24 years was elevated, albeit
not significantly (odds ratio [OR] = 1.55; 95%  confidence interval [CI] = 0.91–2.70). The
FDA meta-analyses reveal an absolute risk of suicide in patients taking investigational an-
tidepressants of 0.01%. In conc lusion, suicide is clearly an extremely rare treatment-emer-

"Differential Diagnosis
Substance intoxication and withdrawal. Depressive symptoms occur commonly in sub-
stance intoxication and substance withdrawal, and the diagnosis of the substance-specific
intoxication or withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A
diagnosis of substance-induced depressive di sorder should be made  instead of a diag-
nosis of substance intoxicati on or substance withdrawal when the mood symptoms are
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, dysphoric
mood is a characteristic feature of coca ine withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced
depressive disorder should be diagnosed inst ead of cocaine withdrawal only if the mood
disturbance is substantially more intense or longer lasting than what is usually encountered
with cocaine withdrawal and is sufficiently seve re to be a separate focus of attention and
treatment.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,224

Primary depressive disorder. A substance/medication-induc ed depressive disorder is

and Course” for this disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,225
"Depressive disorder due to another medical condition. Because individuals with other
medical conditions often take medications for th ose conditions, the clinician must consider the
possibility that the mood symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the med-
ical condition rather than the medication, in which case depres sive disorder due to another
medical condition is diagnosed. The history often provides the primary basis for such a judg-
ment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g., medication sub-
stitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine empirically whether the medication
is the causative agent. If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is a function of both
another medical condition and su bstance use or withdrawal, both  diagnoses (i.e., depressive
disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced depressive
disorder) may be given. When there is insuffic ient evidence to determine whether the depres-
sive symptoms are associated with substance (including a medication) ingestion or with-
drawal or with another medical condition or are primary (i.e., not a function of either a
substance or another medical condition), a diagno sis of other specified depressive disorder or

The essential feature of depressive disorder  due to another medical condition is a promi-
nent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or plea-
sure in all, or almost all, ac tivities that predominates in th e clinical picture (Criterion A)
and that is thought to be related to the direct  physiological effects of another medical con-
dition (Criterion B). In determining whethe r the mood disturbance is due to a general
medical condition, the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical con-
dition. Further, the clinician mu st establish that the mood di sturbance is etiologically re-
lated to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism. A careful and
comprehensive assessment of multiple factor s is necessary to make this judgment. Al-
though there are no infallible guidelines  for determining whether the relationship
between the mood disturbance and the general medical condition is etiological, several
considerations provide some guidance in this area. One consideration is the presence of a
temporal association between th e onset, exacerbation, or remission of the general medical
condition and that of the mood disturbance. A second consideration is the presence of fea-
tures that are atypical of prim ary Mood Disorders (e.g., atypic al age at onset or course or
absence of family history). Evidence from the literature that suggests th at there can be a di-
rect association between the general medical condition in question and the development
of mood symptoms can provide a useful contex t in the assessment of a particular situation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,226

series, the duration of the major depressive episode follo wing stroke was 9–11 months on
average. Similarly, in Huntington’s disease the depressive state comes quite early in the
course of the illness. With Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease, it often precedes
the major motor impairments and cognitive impairments associ ated with each condition",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,227

Risk and Prognostic Factors
The risk of acute onset of a major depressive disorder following a CVA (within 1 day to a
week of the event) appears to be strongly correlated with lesion location, with greatest risk
associated with left frontal strokes and least risk apparently associated with right frontal
lesions in those individuals who present within days of the stroke. The association with

"Note:  The specifier “with melancholic features” is applied if these features are present
at the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of the ca-
pacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reac-
tivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked
brightening of mood. Either mood does not bri ghten at all, or it brightens only partially
(e.g., up to 20%–40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “distinct quality” of mood
that is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” specifier is experienced as qual-
itatively different from that during a nonm elancholic depressive episode. A depressed
mood that is described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a rea-

weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at
least an hour a day but often lasts for many  hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical
features, pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has

"189Anxiety
 Disorders
Anxiety disorders  include disorders that share feat ures of excessive fear and anxi-
ety and related behavioral disturbances. Fear  is the emotional response to real or per-
ceived imminent threat, whereas anxiety is anticipation of future threat. Obviously, these
two states overlap, but they a lso differ, with fear more ofte n associated with surges of au-
tonomic arousal necessary for fight or flight , thoughts of immediate danger, and escape
behaviors, and anxiety more often associated with muscle tension and vigilance in prep-
aration for future danger and cautious or avoidant behavior s. Sometimes the level of fear
or anxiety is reduced by pervasive avoidance behaviors. Panic attacks  feature prominently
within the anxiety disorders as a particular ty pe of fear response. Panic attacks are not lim-
ited to anxiety disorders but rather can be  seen in other mental disorders as well",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,234
"The anxiety disorders differ from one anothe r in the types of objects or situations that
induce fear, anxiety, or avoidance behavior, and the associated cognitive ideation. Thus,
while the anxiety disorders tend to be highly comorbid with each other, they can be dif-
ferentiated by close examination of the types of  situations that are feared or avoided and
the content of the associated thoughts or beliefs. 
Anxiety disorders differ from developmentally  normative fear or anxiety by being ex-
cessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate periods. They differ from tran-
sient fear or anxiety, often st ress-induced, by being persistent (e.g., typically lasting 6 months
or more), although the criterion for duration is intended as a general guide with allowance
for some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of shorter duration in children (as in sepa-
ration anxiety disorder  and selective mutism). Since in dividuals with anxiety disorders
typically overestimate the danger in situations  they fear or avoid, the primary determina-
tion of whether the fear or anxiety is excessive or out of proportion is made by the clinician,
taking cultural contextual fa ctors into account. Many of the anxiety disorders develop in
childhood and tend to persist if not treated. Most occur more frequent ly in females than in
males (approximately 2:1 ratio). Each anxiety disorder is diagnosed only when the symp-
toms are not attributable to th e physiological effects of a substance/medication or to another
medical condition or are not better explained by another mental disorder. 
The chapter is arranged developmentally, with disord ers sequenced according to the
typical age at onset. The individual with sepa ration anxiety disorder is fearful or anxious
about separation from attachment figures to a degree that is developmentally inappro-
priate. There is persistent fear or anxiety about harm coming to attachment figures and
events that could lead to loss of or separati on from attachment figures and reluctance to go
away from attachment figures, as well as nightmares and physical symptoms of distress. Al-
though the symptoms often deve lop in childhood, they can be  expressed throughout adult-
hood as well",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,234

to the actual risk posed. There are various ty pes of specific phobias: animal; natural envi-
ronment; blood-injectio n-injury; situational; and other situations. 
In social anxiety disorder (social phobia), the individual is fearful or anxious about or
avoidant of social interactions and situations  that involve the possi bility of being scruti-
nized. These include social interactions such as meeting unfamiliar people, situations in
which the individual may be observed eating or drinking, and situations in which the in-
dividual performs in front of others. The cogn itive ideation is of being negatively evalu-
ated by others, by being em barrassed, humiliated, or re jected, or offending others",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,235
"In panic disorder, the individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks and is
persistently concerned or worr ied about having more panic attacks or changes his or her

that reach a peak within minutes, accompan ied by physical and/or cognitive symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,235
"Limited-symptom panic attacks include fewer than four symptoms. Panic attacks may be

prognostic factor for severity of diagnosis, co urse, and comorbidity ac ross an array of dis-
orders, including, but not limit ed to, the anxiety disorders (e.g., substance use, depressive
and psychotic disorders). Panic attack may therefore be used as a descriptive specifier for

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of separation anxiety disorder is excessive fear or anxiety concerning
separation from home or attachment figures. The anxiety exceeds what may be expected
given the person’s developmental level (Criteri on A). Individuals with separation anxiety
disorder have symptoms that meet at least th ree of the following criteria: They experience
recurrent excessive distress when separation fr om home or major atta chment figures is an-
ticipated or occurs (Criterion A1). They wo rry about the well-being or death of attachment
figures, particularly when separated from them, and they need to know the whereabouts
of their attachment figures and want to stay in touch with them (Criterion A2). They also
worry about untoward events to themselves, such as getting los t, being kidnapped, or
having an accident, that would keep them fr om ever being reunited with their major at-
tachment figure (Criterion A3). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are reluctant
or refuse to go out by themselves because of  separation fears (Criterion A4). They have
persistent and excessive fear or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment
figures at home or in other settings. Children with separa tion anxiety disorder may be un-
able to stay or go in a room by themselv es and may display “clinging” behavior, staying
close to or “shadowing” the parent around the house, or requiring someone to be with
them when going to another room in the house (Criterion A5). They have persistent reluc-
tance or refusal to go to sleep without bein g near a major attachme nt figure or to sleep
away from home (Criterion A6). Children with  this disorder often have difficulty at bed-
time and may insist that someone stay with them until they fall asleep. During the night,
they may make their way to their parents’ bed (or that of a significant other, such as a sib-
ling). Children may be reluctant or refuse to at tend camp, to sleep at friends’ homes, or to
go on errands. Adults may be uncomfortable when traveling independently (e.g., sleeping
in a hotel room). There may be repeated nightmares in which the content expresses the in-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,236

dividual’s separation anxiety (e.g., destructio n of the family through fire, murder, or other
catastrophe) (Criterion A7). Physical sympto ms (e.g., headaches, abdominal complaints,
nausea, vomiting) are common in children when separation from major attachment fig-
ures occurs or is anticipated (Criterion A8). Cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations,
dizziness, and feeling faint are rare in youn ger children but may occur in adolescents and
adults",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,237
"The disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents
younger than 18 years and is typically 6 months or longer in adults (Criterion B). However,
the duration criterion for adults should be used as a general guide, with allowance for
some degree of flexibilit y. The disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, academic, occupational, or  other important areas of functioning (Cri-
terion C). 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
When separated from major attachment figure s, children with separation anxiety disorder
may exhibit social withdrawal, apathy, sadne ss, or difficulty concentrating on work or
play. Depending on their age, individuals may have fears of animals, monsters, the dark,
muggers, burglars, kidnappers, car accidents, plane travel, and other situations that are
perceived as presenting danger to the family or themselves. So me individuals become
homesick and uncomfortable to the point of misery when away from home. Separation
anxiety disorder in children may lead to school refusal, which in turn may lead to academic
difficulties and social isolation. When extrem ely upset at the prospect of separation, chil-
dren may show anger or occasionally aggres sion toward someone who is forcing separa-
tion. When alone, especially in  the evening or the dark, youn g children may report unusual
perceptual experiences (e.g., seeing people p eering into their room, frightening creatures
reaching for them, feeling eyes staring at them ). Children with this disorder may be de-
scribed as demanding, intrusive, and in need of constant attention, and, as adults, may ap-
pear dependent and overprotective. The indi vidual’s excessive de mands often become a
source of frustration fo r family members, leading to resent ment and conflict in the family",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,237

the disorder is more frequent in females",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,237
"Development and Course
Periods of heightened separation anxiety from attachment figures are part of normal early
development and may indicate the development of secure attachment relationships (e.g.,
around 1 year of age, when infants may suffe r from stranger anxiety). Onset of separation
anxiety disorder may be as early as preschoo l age and may occur at any time during child-
hood and more rarely in adolescence. Typica lly there are periods of  exacerbation and re-
mission. In some cases, both the anxiety ab out possible separation and the avoidance of
situations involving separation from the home or nuclear family (e.g., going away to col-
lege, moving away from attachment figure s) may persist through adulthood. However,
the majority of children with separation anxiety disorder are free of impairing anxiety dis-
orders over their lifetimes. Many  adults with separation anxi ety disorder do not recall a

The manifestations of separation anxiety di sorder vary with age. Younger children are
more reluctant to go to school or may avoi d school altogether. Younger children may not
express worries or specific fears of definite th reats to parents, home, or themselves, and the
anxiety is manifested only when separation  is experienced. As children age, worries
emerge; these are often worries about specific  dangers (e.g., accidents, kidnapping, mug-
ging, death) or vague concerns about not being reunited with attachment figures. In adults,
separation anxiety disorder may limit their ability to cope with changes in circumstances
(e.g., moving, getting married). Adults with the disorder are typically overconcerned about
their offspring and spouses and experience ma rked discomfort when separated from them",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,238
"They may also experience significant disruption in work or social experiences because of
needing to continuously check on the whereabouts of a significant other. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors  
Environmental. Separation anxiety disorder often deve lops after life stress, especially a
loss (e.g., the death of a relative  or pet; an illness of the individual or a relative; a change of
schools; parental divorce; a move to a new neighborhood; immigratio n; a disaster that in-
volved periods of separation from attachment  figures). In young adults, other examples of
life stress include leaving the parental home, en tering into a romantic relationship, and be-
coming a parent. Parental overprotection and intrusiveness may be associated with sepa-
ration anxiety disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,238
Genetic and physiological. Separation anxiety disorder in  children may be heritable,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,238
"Heritability was estimated at 73% in a communi ty sample of 6-year-old twins, with higher
rates in girls. Children with separation an xiety disorder display particularly enhanced
sensitivity to respirat ory stimulation using CO2-enriched air",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,238
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
There are cultural variations in  the degree to which it is co nsidered desirable to tolerate
separation, so that demands and opportunit ies for separation between parents and chil-
dren are avoided in some cultures. For exampl e, there is wide variation across countries
and cultures with respect to the age at which it  is expected that offspring should leave the
parental home. It is important to differenti ate separation anxiety disorder from the high
value some cultures place on strong interdependence among family members",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,238
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Girls manifest greater reluctance to attend or  avoidance of school th an boys. Indirect ex-
pression of fear of separation may be more common in males than in females, for example,
by limited independent activity , reluctance to be away from  home alone, or distress when
spouse or offspring do things independently or when contact with spouse or offspring is
not possible",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,238
"Suicide Risk
Separation anxiety disorder in children may be associated with an increased risk for sui-
cide. In a community sample, the presence of mood disorders,  anxiety disorders, or sub-
stance use has been associated with suicidal ideation and attempts. However, this
association is not specific to separation anxi ety disorder and is found in several anxiety
disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,238

Differential Diagnosis
Generalized anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety disorder is distinguished from gener-
alized anxiety disorder in that  the anxiety predominantly concerns separation from attach-
ment figures, and if other wo rries occur, they do not pred ominate the clinical picture. 
Panic disorder. Threats of separation may lead to extreme anxiety and even a panic at-
tack. In separation anxiety disorder, in contr ast to panic disorder, the anxiety concerns the
possibility of being away from attachment figures and worry about untoward events be-
falling them, rather than being incapacitated by an unexpected panic attack. 
Agoraphobia. Unlike individuals with agoraphobia, those with separation anxiety dis-
order are not anxious about being trapped or incapacitated in situations from which es-
cape is perceived as difficult in the event of panic-like sy mptoms or other incapacitating
symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,239
"Conduct disorder. School avoidance (truancy) is common in conduct disorder, but anx-
iety about separation is not responsible for school absences, and the child or adolescent
usually stays away from, rather  than returns to, the home. 
Social anxiety disorder. School refusal may be due to soci al anxiety disorder (social pho-
bia). In such instances, the school avoidance is due to fear of being judged negatively by oth-
ers rather than to worries about being separated from the attachment figures. 
Posttraumatic stress disorder. Fear of separation from loved ones is common after trau-
matic events such as a disasters, particularly when periods of separation from loved ones
were experienced during the traumatic event. In posttraumatic stress  disorder (PTSD), the
central symptoms concern intr usions about, and avoidance of, memories associated with
the traumatic event itself, whereas in separa tion anxiety disorder, the worries and avoid-
ance concern the well-being of attachme nt figures and separation from them",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,239
"Illness anxiety disorder. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder worry about specific
illnesses they may have, but the main concer n is about the medical diagnosis itself, not
about being separated fr om attachment figures",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,239
"Bereavement. Intense yearning or longing for th e deceased, intense sorrow and emo-
tional pain, and preoccupation with the deceased or the circumstances of the death are ex-
pected responses occurring in  bereavement, whereas fear of separation from other

"Depressive and bipolar disorders. These disorders may be associated with reluctance
to leave home, but the main concern is not wo rry or fear of untoward events befalling at-
tachment figures, but rather low motivation for engaging with the outside world. How-
ever, individuals with separation anxiety disorder may become depressed while being
separated or in anticipation of separation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,239

ceptual experiences that may occur in separati on anxiety disorder are usually based on a
misperception of an actual stimulus, occur only in certain situations (e.g., nighttime), and
are reversed by the presence of an attachment figure.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,239
"Selective Mutism 195
Personality disorders. Dependent personality disorder is characterized by an indis-
criminate tendency to rely on others, wherea s separation anxiety disorder involves con-
cern about the proximity and safety of main attachment figures. Bo rderline personality
disorder is characterized by fear of abandonm ent by loved ones, but problems in identity,
self-direction, interpersonal fu nctioning, and impulsivity are additionally central to that
disorder, whereas they are not centra l to separation anxiety disorder. 
Comorbidity
In children, separation anxiety disorder is hi ghly comorbid with ge neralized anxiety dis-
order and specific phobia. In adults, comm on comorbidities include specific phobia,

"Diagnostic Features
When encountering other individuals in social interactions, children with selective mut-
ism do not initiate speech or reciprocally respond when spoken to by others. Lack of
speech occurs in social interactions with chil dren or adults. Children with selective mut-
ism will speak in their home in the presence  of immediate family members but often not
even in front of close friends or second-degr ee relatives, such as grandparents or cousins",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,240
"The disturbance is often marked by high social  anxiety. Children with selective mutism of-
ten refuse to speak at school, leading to ac ademic or educational impairment, as teachers
often find it difficult to assess skills such as reading. The lack of speech may interfere with
social communication, although children wi th this disorder sometimes use nonspoken or
nonverbal means (e.g., grunting, pointing, wr iting) to communicate and may be willing or
eager to perform or engage in social encounters when speech is not required (e.g., nonver-
bal parts in school plays).

"Prevalence
Selective mutism is a relatively  rare disorder and has not been  included as a diagnostic cat-
egory in epidemiological studies of prevalen ce of childhood disorders. Point prevalence
using various clinic or school samples ranges between 0.03% and 1% depending on the set-
ting (e.g., clinic vs. school vs. general population) and ages  of the individual s in the sample",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,241
"The prevalence of the disorder does not seem to vary by sex or race/ethnicity. The disor-
der is more likely to manifest in young children than in adolescents and adults",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,241
"Development and Course
The onset of selective mutism is usually befo re age 5 years, but the disturbance may not
come to clinical attention until entry into scho ol, where there is an increase in social inter-
action and performance tasks, such as readin g aloud. The persistence of the disorder is
variable. Although clinical reports suggest that many individuals “outgrow” selective
mutism, the longitudinal course of the disorder  is unknown. In some cases, particularly in
individuals with social anxiety disorder, selective mutism may disappear, but symptoms
of social anxiety disorder remain. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Temperamental risk factors for sele ctive mutism are not well identi-
fied. Negative affectivity (neuroticism) or be havioral inhibition may play a role, as may
parental history of shyness, social isolation,  and social anxiety. Children with selective
mutism may have subtle receptive language difficulties compared wi th their peers, al-
though receptive language is still within the normal range. 
Environmental. Social inhibition on the part of parents may serve as a model for social
reticence and selective mutism in children. Furthermore, parents of children with selective
mutism have been described as  overprotective or more cont rolling than parents of chil-
dren with other anxiety d isorders or no disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,241

It is common for individuals to have multiple  specific phobias. The average individual with

specific phobia fear more than on e situation or object. In such cases, multiple specific phobia
diagnoses, each with its own diagnostic code reflecting the phobic stimulus, would need to be
given. For example, if an individual fears thunderstorms and flying , then two diagnoses
would be given: specific phobia, natural en vironment, and specific phobia, situational",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,243
"Diagnostic Features
A key feature of this disorder is that the fear or anxiety is circumscribed to the presence of a
particular situation or object (Criterion A), which may be termed the phobic stimulus.  The cat-
egories of feared situations or objects are provi ded as specifiers. Many individuals fear objects
or situations from more than one category, or  phobic stimulus. For th e diagnosis of specific
phobia, the response must differ from normal, transient fears that commonly occur in the pop-
ulation. To meet the criteria for a diagnosis, the fear or anxiety must be intense or severe (i.e.,
“marked”) (Criterion A). The amount of fear experienced may vary wi th proximity to the
feared object or situation and may occur in anticipa tion of or in the actual presence of the object
or situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of a full or limited symptom panic at-
tack (i.e., expected panic attack). Another characteri stic of specific phobias is that fear or anxi-
ety is evoked nearly every time the individual  comes into contact with the phobic stimulus
(Criterion B). Thus, an indivi dual who becomes anxious only occasionally upon being con-
fronted with the situation or object (e.g., become s anxious when flying only on one out of every
five airplane flights) would not be diagnosed with specific phobia. However, the degree of fear
or anxiety expressed may vary (from anticipatory anxiety to a full panic attack) across different
occasions of encountering the phobic object or situation because of various contextual factors
such as the presence of others, duration of exposure, and other threat ening elements such as
turbulence on a flight for indi viduals who fear flying. Fear and anxiety are often expressed dif-
ferently between children and adults. Also, the fear  or anxiety occurs as soon as the phobic ob-
ject or situation is encountered (i.e., immediately rather than being delayed). 
The individual actively avoids the situation, or  if he or she either is unable or decides
not to avoid it, the situation or object evok es intense fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Active
avoidance  means the individual intentionally behave s in ways that are designed to prevent
or minimize contact with phobic objects or situ ations (e.g., takes tunnels instead of bridges
on daily commute to work for fear of heights; avoids entering a dark room for fear of spi-
ders; avoids accepting a job in a locale wh ere a phobic stimulus is more common). Avoid-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,243
"Specific Phobia 199
ance behaviors are often obvious (e.g., an indi vidual who fears blood refusing to go to the
doctor) but are sometimes less obvious (e.g., an individual who fears snakes refusing to
look at pictures that resemble  the form or shape of snakes).  Many individuals with specific
phobias have suffered over many years and have changed their living circumstances in
ways designed to avoid the phobic object or si tuation as much as possible (e.g., an indi-
vidual diagnosed with specific phobia, animal , who moves to reside in an area devoid of
the particular feared animal). Therefore, they no longer experience fear or anxiety in their
daily life. In such instances, avoidance behavi ors or ongoing refusal to engage in activities
that would involve exposure to the phobic object or situation (e.g., repeated refusal to ac-
cept offers for work-related travel because of fear of flying) may be  helpful in confirming
the diagnosis in the absence of overt anxiety or panic. 
The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to th e actual danger that the object or situation
poses, or more intense than is deemed necess ary (Criterion D). Although individuals with
specific phobia often recognize their reactions as disproportionate, th ey tend to overesti-
mate the danger in their feared situations, an d thus the judgment of being out of propor-
tion is made by the cl inician. The individual ’s sociocultural contex t should also be taken
into account. For example, fears of the dark may be reasonable in a context of ongoing
violence, and fear of insects may be more di sproportionate in settings where insects are
consumed in the diet. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for
6 months or more (Criterion E), which helps distinguish the disorder from transient fears
that are common in the popu lation, particularly among children. However, the duration
criterion should be used as a general guide,  with allowance for so me degree of flexibility",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,244

cupational, or other important areas of functioning in order for the disorder to be diag-

"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with specific phobia typically experience an increase in physiological arousal
in anticipation of or during exposure to a phobic object or situation. However, the physi-
ological response to the feared situation or object varies. Whereas individuals with situa-
tional, natural environment, an d animal specific phobias are likely to show sympathetic
nervous system arousal, individuals with bloo d-injection-injury specific phobia often
demonstrate a vasovagal fainting or near-faint ing response that is marked by initial brief
acceleration of heart rate an d elevation of blood pressure followed by a deceleration of
heart rate and a drop in blood pressure. Curr ent neural systems models for specific phobia
emphasize the amygdala and related structures, much as in other anxiety disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,244
"Prevalence
In the United States, the 12-month community prevalence estimate for specific phobia is
approximately 7%–9%. Prevalence  rates in European countrie s are largely similar to those
in the United States (e.g., about 6%), but rate s are generally lower in  Asian, African, and
Latin American countries (2%–4%). Prevalence  rates are approximately 5% in children and
are approximately 16% in 13- to 17-year-olds. Prevalence rates are lower in older individ-
uals (about 3%–5%), possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels. Females
are more frequently affected than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1, although rates vary
across different phobic stimuli. That is, animal, natural envi ronment, and situational spe-
cific phobias are predominantly experienced by females, whereas blood-injection-injury
phobia is experienced nearly equally by both genders. 
Development and Course
Specific phobia sometimes develops following  a traumatic event (e.g., being attacked by
an animal or stuck in an elevat or), observation of others going through a traumatic event (e.g.,",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,244
"200 Anxiety Disorders
watching someone drown), an unexpected panic attack in the to be feared situation (e.g.,
an unexpected panic attack while on the subway), or informational transmission (e.g., ex-
tensive media coverage of a plane crash). However, many individuals with specific phobia
are unable to recall the specific reason for the onset of their phobias. Specific phobia usu-
ally develops in early childho od, with the majority of case s developing prior to age 10
years. The median age at onset is between 7 and 11 years, with the mean at about 10 years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,245
"Situational specific phobias tend to have a later age at onset than natural environment, an-
imal, or blood-injection-injury specific phob ias. Specific phobias that develop in child-
hood and adolescence are likely to wax and wane during that period. However, phobias
that do persist into adulthood are unlikely to remit for the majority of individuals. 
When specific phobia is being diagnosed in children, two issues sh ould be considered",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,245
"First, young children may express their fear and anxiety by crying, tantrums, freezing,
or clinging. Second, young children typically are not able to understand the concept of
avoidance. Therefore, the clinician should assemble additional information from parents,
teachers, or others who know  the child well. Excessive fears are quite common in young
children but are usually transitory and only m ildly impairing and thus considered devel-
opmentally appropriate. In such cases a diag nosis of specific phobia would not be made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,245
"When the diagnosis of specific phobia is being considered in a child, it is important to
assess the degree of im pairment and the duration of the fear, anxiety, or avoidance, and
whether it is typical for the child’s  particular developmental stage. 
Although the prevalence of specific phobia is lower in older populations, it remains
one of the more commonly experienced disorders in late life. Several issues should be con-
sidered when diagnosing specific phobia in  older populations. Fi rst, older individuals
may be more likely to endorse natural envi ronment specific phobias, as well as phobias of
falling. Second, specific phobia (like all anxiet y disorders) tends to co-occur with  medical
concerns in older individuals, including co ronary heart disease and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. Third, older individuals may be more likely to attribute the symptoms
of anxiety to medical conditions. Fourth, olde r individuals may be more likely to manifest
anxiety in an atypical manner (e.g., involvin g symptoms of both anxiety and depression)
and thus be more likely to warrant a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder. Addition-
ally, the presence of specific phobia in olde r adults is associated with decreased quality of
life and may serve as a risk factor for major neurocognitive disorder. 
Although most specific phobias develop in ch ildhood and adolescence, it is possible for a
specific phobia to develop at any age, often as the result of expe riences that are traumatic. For
example, phobias of choking almost always follow a near-choking event at any age. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Temperamental risk factors for specif ic phobia, such as negative affec-
tivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition, are risk factors for ot her anxiety disorders as
well. 
Environmental. Environmental risk factors for specif ic phobias, such as parental over-
protectiveness, parental loss and separation, and physical and sexual abuse, tend to pre-
dict other anxiety disorders as well. As note d earlier, negative or traumatic encounters
with the feared object or situation sometime s (but not always) precede the development of
specific phobia. 
Genetic and physiological. There may be a genetic suscepti bility to a certain category of
specific phobia (e.g., an individual with a first-degree relative with a specific phobia of an-
imals is significantly more likely to have the same specific phobia than any other category
of phobia). Individuals with blood-injection- injury phobia show a unique propensity to
vasovagal syncope (fainting) in th e presence of the phobic stimulus.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,245
"Specific Phobia 201
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
In the United States, Asians and Latinos report  significantly lower rates of specific phobia
than non-Latino whites, African Americans, an d Native Americans. In addition to having
lower prevalence rates of specific phobia, some  countries outside of the United States, par-
ticularly Asian and African countries, show differing phobia content, age at onset, and
gender ratios. 
Suicide Risk 
Individuals with specific phobia are up to 60 % more likely to make a suicide attempt than
are individuals without the diagnosis. However, it is likely that these elevated rates are
primarily due to como rbidity with personality disorder s and other anxiety disorders. 
Functional Consequences of Specific Phobia
Individuals with specific phobia show simi lar patterns of impairment in psychosocial
functioning and decreased quality of life as individuals with other anxiety disorders and
alcohol and substance use disorders, includ ing impairments in occupational and inter-
personal functioning. In older adults, impair ment may be seen in caregiving duties and
volunteer activities. Also, fear of falling in older adults can lead to reduced mobility and
reduced physical and social functioning, an d may lead to receiving formal or informal
home support. The distress and impairment caused by specif ic phobias tend to increase
with the number of feared objects and situat ions. Thus, an individual who fears four ob-
jects or situations is likely to have more im pairment in his or her occupational and social
roles and a lower quality of life than an indivi dual who fears only one object or situation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,246
"Individuals with blood-injection-injury specif ic phobia are often reluctant to obtain med-

Differential Diagnosis
Agoraphobia. Situational specific phobia may resemble agoraphobia in its clinical pre-
sentation, given the overlap in feared situations (e.g., flying, enclosed places, elevators). If
an individual fears only one of the agorapho bia situations, then sp ecific phobia, situa-
tional, may be diagnosed. If two or more agoraphobic situations are feared, a diagnosis of
agoraphobia is likely warranted. For example,  an individual who fears airplanes and ele-
vators (which overlap with the “public transportation” ag oraphobic situation) but does
not fear other agoraphobic situations would be diagnosed with specific phobia, situa-
tional, whereas an individual who fears airplanes, elevators, and crowds (which overlap
with two agoraphobic situations, “using public transportation” and “standing in line and
or being in a crowd”) would be diagnosed wi th agoraphobia. Criterion B of agoraphobia
(the situations are feared or avoided “because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or
help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other inca-
pacitating or embarrassing symptoms”) can also  be useful in differentiating agoraphobia
from specific phobia. If the situations are fe ared for other reasons, such as fear of being
harmed directly by the object or situations (e.g ., fear of the plane crashing, fear of the an-
imal biting), a specific phobia diagnosis may be more appropriate. 
Social anxiety disorder. If the situations are feared because of negative evaluation, so-
cial anxiety disorder should be di agnosed instead of  specific phobia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,246

primary caregiver or attachment figure, separation anxiety disorder should be diagnosed
instead of specific phobia.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,246
"202 Anxiety Disorders
Panic disorder. Individuals with specific phobia may experience panic attacks when con-
fronted with their feared situation or object. A diagnosis of specific phobia would be given if
the panic attacks only occurred in response to the specific obje ct or situation, whereas a di-
agnosis of panic disorder woul d be given if the individual also experienced panic attacks
that were unexpected (i.e., not in response to  the specific phobia object or situation)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,247
"Obsessive-compulsive disorder. If an individual’s primary fear or anxiety is of an ob-
ject or situation as a result of  obsessions (e.g., fear of bloo d due to obsessive thoughts about
contamination from blood-borne pathogens [i.e., HIV]; fear of  driving due to obsessive im-
ages of harming others), and if other diagnostic criteria for obsess ive-compulsive disorder
are met, then obsessive-compulsive disorder should be diagnosed. 
Trauma- and stressor-related disorders. If the phobia develops following a traumatic
event, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be considered as a diagnosis. How-
ever, traumatic events ca n precede the onset of PTSD and sp ecific phobia. In this case, a di-
agnosis of specific phobia would be assigned only if all of the criteria for PTSD are not met. 
Eating disorders. A diagnosis of specific phobia is not given if the avoidance behavior is
exclusively limited to avoidance of food and food-related cues, in which case a diagnosis
of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa should be considered",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,247
"Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. When the fear and avoidance
are due to delusional thinking (as in schizo phrenia or other schizophrenia spectrum and
other psychotic disorders), a diagnosis of specific phobia is not warranted. 
Comorbidity
Specific phobia is rarely seen in medical-clinical settings in the absence of other psycho-
pathology and is more frequently seen in nonm edical mental health settings. Specific pho-
bia is frequently associated with a range of ot her disorders, especially depression in older
adults. Because of early onset, specific phobia is typically the temporally primary disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,247

"Specifiers
Individuals with the performanc e only type of social anxiety disorder have performance
fears that are typically most impairing in thei r professional lives (e.g., musicians, dancers,
performers, athletes) or in roles that requir e regular public speaking. Performance fears
may also manifest in work, school, or academic  settings in which regular public presenta-
tions are required. Individuals with performance only social anxiety disorder do not fear
or avoid nonperformanc e social situations. 
Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of social an xiety disorder is a marked, or in tense, fear or anxiety of so-
cial situations in which the individual may be scrutinized by others. In children the fear or
anxiety must occur in p eer settings and not just during in teractions with adults (Criterion
A). When exposed to such social situations, the individual fears that he or she will be neg-
atively evaluated. The individu al is concerned that he or she will be judged as anxious,
weak, crazy, stupid, boring, intimidating, dirt y, or unlikable. The individual fears that
he or she will act or appear in a certain way or show anxiety symptoms, such as blushing,
trembling, sweating, stumbling over one’s words, or staring, that will be negatively eval-
uated by others (Criterion B). Some individuals fear offending others or being rejected as
a result. Fear of offending others—for exampl e, by a gaze or by showing anxiety symp-
toms—may be the predominant fear in individu als from cultures with strong collectivistic
orientations. An individual with fear of tr embling of the hands ma y avoid drinking, eat-
ing, writing, or pointing in public; an individual with fear of sweating may avoid shaking
hands or eating spicy foods; and an individual with fear of blushing may avoid public per-
formance, bright lights,  or discussion about intimate to pics. Some individuals fear and
avoid urinating in public restrooms when other individuals are present (i.e., paruresis, or
“shy bladder syndrome”). 
The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Thus, an in-
dividual who becomes anxious only occasionally in the social situatio n(s) would not be di-
agnosed with social anxiety di sorder. However, the degree an d type of fear and anxiety
may vary (e.g., anticipatory anxiety, a panic attack) across different occasions. The antici-
patory anxiety may occur sometimes far in adva nce of upcoming situations (e.g., worrying
every day for weeks before attending a social ev ent, repeating a speech for days in advance)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,248
"In children, the fear or anxiety may be expre ssed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, or
shrinking in social situations. The individual will often avoid the feared social situations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,248

"204 Anxiety Disorders
ance can be extensive (e.g., not going to partie s, refusing school) or subtle (e.g., overpre-
paring the text of a speech, diverting at tention to others, limiting eye contact). 
The fear or anxiety is judged to be out of proportion to the actual risk of being nega-
tively evaluated or to the consequences of su ch negative evaluation  (Criterion E). Some-
times, the anxiety may not be judged to be excessive, because it is related to an actual
danger (e.g., being bullied or tormented by ot hers). However, individuals with social anx-
iety disorder often overestimate the negative  consequences of social situations, and thus
the judgment of being out of proportion is ma de by the clinician. The individual’s socio-
cultural context needs to be taken into account when this judgment is being made. For ex-
ample, in certain cultures, behavior that mi ght otherwise appear socially anxious may be
considered appropriate in social situations (e .g., might be seen as a sign of respect)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,249
"The duration of the disturbance is typically at least 6 months (Criterion F). This dura-
tion threshold helps distinguish the disorder from transient social fears that are com-
mon, particularly among children and in the community. However, th e duration criterion
should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The fear,
anxiety, and avoidance must interfere significa ntly with the individual’s normal routine,
occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relation ships, or must cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning (Criterion G). For example, an individual who is afraid to speak in pub-
lic would not receive a diagnosis of social anxi ety disorder if this activity is not routinely
encountered on the job or in classroom work, an d if the individual is not significantly dis-
tressed about it. However, if the individual avoi ds, or is passed over for, the job or educa-
tion he or she really wants because of so cial anxiety symptoms, Criterion G is met. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with social anxiety disorder may be inadequately assertive or excessively sub-
missive or, less commonly, highly controlling of the conversation. They may show overly
rigid body posture or inadequate eye contact, or  speak with an overly soft voice. These in-
dividuals may be shy or withdrawn, and they may be less open in conversations and dis-
close little about themselves. They may seek em ployment in jobs that  do not require social
contact, although this is not the case for indi viduals with social anxiety disorder, perfor-
mance only. They may live at home longer. Men may be delayed in marrying and having
a family, whereas women who would want to work outside the home may live a life as
homemaker and mother. Self-medication with substances is common (e.g., drinking be-
fore going to a party). Social anxiety among older adults may also include exacerbation of
symptoms of medical illnesses, such as increa sed tremor or tachycardia. Blushing is a hall-
mark physical response of social anxiety disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,249
"Prevalence
The 12-month prevalence estimate of social an xiety disorder for the United States is ap-
proximately 7%. Lower 12-month prevalence esti mates are seen in much of the world us-
ing the same diagnostic instrument, clusteri ng around 0.5%–2.0%; median prevalence in
Europe is 2.3%. The 12-month prevalence rates in children and adolescents are comparable
to those in adults. Prevalence rates decrease  with age. The 12-mont h prevalence for older
adults ranges from 2% to 5%. In general, high er rates of social anxiety disorder are found
in females than in males in the general popu lation (with odds ratios ranging from 1.5 to
2.2), and the gender difference in prevalen ce is more pronounced in adolescents and
young adults. Gender rates are equivalent or slightly higher for males in clinical samples,
and it is assumed that gender roles and social  expectations play a significant role in ex-
plaining the heightened help-seeking behavior  in male patients. Prevalence in the United
States is higher in American Indians and lowe r in persons of Asian, Latino, African Amer-
ican, and Afro-Caribbean descent compared with non-Hispanic whites.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,249
"Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia) 205
Development and Course
Median age at onset of social anxiety disorder  in the United States is 13 years, and 75% of
individuals have an age at onset between 8 and 15 years. The disord er sometimes emerges
out of a childhood history of social inhibition or shyness in U.S. and European studies. On-
set can also occur in early childhood. Onset of  social anxiety disorder may follow a stress-
ful or humiliating experience (e.g., being bu llied, vomiting during a public speech), or it
may be insidious, developing slowly. First onse t in adulthood is relatively rare and is more
likely to occur after a stressful or humiliating event or after life changes that require new
social roles (e.g., marrying someone from a different social class, receiving a job promo-
tion). Social anxiety disorder may diminish after an individual with fear of dating marries
and may reemerge after divorce. Among individu als presenting to clinical care, the disor-
der tends to be particularly persistent. 
Adolescents endorse a broader pattern of fe ar and avoidance, including of dating,
compared with younger children . Older adults express social anxiety at lower levels but
across a broader range of situations, whereas younger adults express higher levels of so-
cial anxiety for specific situations. In older adults, social anxiet y may concern disability
due to declining sensory functioning (hearing , vision) or embarrassment about one’s ap-
pearance (e.g., tremor as a symptom of Parkin son’s disease) or functioning due to medical
conditions, incontinence, or cogn itive impairment (e.g., forgetting people’s names). In the
community approximately 30% of individuals with social anxiety disorder experience re-
mission of symptoms within 1 year, and about 50% expe rience remission within a few
years. For approximately 60% of individuals wi thout a specific treatment for social anxiety
disorder, the course takes several years or longer",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,250
"Detection of social anxiety disorder in olde r adults may be challenging because of sev-
eral factors, including a focus on somatic symptoms, comorbid me dical illness, limited
insight, changes to social environment or roles that may obscure impairment in social
functioning, or reticence about de scribing psychological distress",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,250

"Environmental. There is no causative role of increa sed rates of childhood maltreatment or
other early-onset psychosocial adversity in th e development of social anxiety disorder. How-
ever, childhood maltreatment an d adversity are risk factors for social anxiety disorder. 
Genetic and physiological. Traits predisposing individual s to social anxiety disorder,
such as behavioral inhibition, are strongly genetically influenced. The genetic influence is
subject to gene-environment interaction; that is, children with high behavioral inhibition
are more susceptible to environmental influe nces, such as socially anxious modeling by
parents. Also, social anxiety disorder is heritable (but performance-only anxiety less so)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,250
"First-degree relatives have a two to six times greater chance of having social anxiety dis-

"Functional Consequences of  Social Anxiety Disorder
Social anxiety disorder is asso ciated with elevated rates of  school dropout and with de-
creased well-being, employment , workplace productivity, soci oeconomic status, and quality
of life. Social anxiety disorder  is also associated with being single, unmarried, or divorced
and with not having children, particularly amon g men. In older adults, there may be impair-
ment in caregiving duties and volunteer activi ties. Social anxiety disorder also impedes lei-
sure activities. Despite the extent of distress  and social impairment associated with social
anxiety disorder, only about half  of individuals with the diso rder in Western societies ever
seek treatment, and they tend to do so only after 15–20 years of experiencing symptoms. Not
being employed is a strong predictor for th e persistence of social anxiety disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,251

tant areas of functioning, a di agnosis of social anxiety disord er should be considered, and

but other evidence for psychotic symptoms is usually present. In individuals with an eat-

Comorbidity
Social anxiety disorder is often comorbid wi th other anxiety disorders, major depressive
disorder, and substance use diso rders, and the onset of social anxiety disorder generally
precedes that of the other disorders, except for specific phobia and separation anxiety dis-
order. Chronic social isolation in the course of  a social anxiety disorder may result in major
depressive disorder. Comorbidity with depression is high also in older adults. Substances
may be used as self-medication for social fe ars, but the symptoms of substance intoxica-
tion or withdrawal, such as trembling, may also be a source of (further) social fear. Social
anxiety disorder is frequently comorbid with  bipolar disorder or body dysmorphic disor-
der; for example, an individual has body dysmorphic disorder co ncerning a preoccupa-
tion with a slight irregularity of her nose, as  well as social anxiety disorder because of a
severe fear of sounding unintelligent. The mo re generalized form of social anxiety disor-
der, but not social anxiety di sorder, performance only, is often comorbid with avoidant

individual is relaxing or emerging from sleep (nocturnal panic attack). In contrast, expected
panic attacks are attacks for which there is an ob vious cue or trigger, such as a situation in
which panic attacks typically occur. The determination of whether panic attacks are ex-
pected or unexpected is made by the clinicia n, who makes this judgment based on a com-
bination of careful questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the
attack and the individual’s own judgment of wh ether or not the attack seemed to occur for
no apparent reason. Cultural interpretation s may influence the assignment of panic at-
tacks as expected or unexpected (see section “Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues” for this
disorder). In the United States and Europe , approximately one-half  of individuals with
panic disorder have expected panic attacks as  well as unexpected panic attacks. Thus, the
presence of expected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic disorder. For
more details regarding expected versus unexpected panic attacks, see the text accompa-
nying panic attacks (pp. 214–217)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,254
"The frequency and severity of panic attacks vary widely. In terms of frequency, there
may be moderately frequent a ttacks (e.g., one per week) for months at a time, or short
bursts of more frequent attacks (e.g., daily) separated by weeks or months without any at-
tacks or with less frequent attacks (e.g., two per month) over many years. Persons who
have infrequent panic attacks resemble person s with more frequent panic attacks in terms
of panic attack symptoms, demographic charac teristics, comorbidity with other disorders,
family history, and biological data. In terms of severity, individuals with panic disorder
may have both full-symptom (four or more symptoms) and limited-symptom (fewer than
four symptoms) attacks, and the number and type of panic attack symptoms frequently
differ from one panic attack to  the next. However, more th an one unexpected full-symp-
tom panic attack is required for the diagnosis of panic disorder. 
The worries about panic attacks or their co nsequences usually pertain to physical con-
cerns, such as worry that panic attacks refl ect the presence of life-threatening illnesses
(e.g., cardiac disease, seizure disorder); social concerns, such  as embarrassment or fear of
being judged negatively by others because of visible panic symptoms; and concerns about
mental functioning, such as “going crazy” or  losing control (Criterion B). The maladaptive
changes in behavior represent attempts to mi nimize or avoid panic attacks or their conse-
quences. Examples include avoiding physical exertion, reorganizing daily life to ensure
that help is available in the event of a pani c attack, restricting usual daily activities, and
avoiding agoraphobia-type situations, such as  leaving home, using pu blic transportation,
or shopping. If agoraphobia is present, a separate diagnosis of agoraphobia is given.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,254
"210 Anxiety Disorders
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
One type of unexpected panic attack is a nocturnal panic attack (i.e., waking from sleep in
a state of panic, which differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep). In the United
States, this type of panic attack has been es timated to occur at leas t one time in roughly
one-quarter to one-third of individuals with  panic disorder, of whom the majority also
have daytime panic attacks. In addition to  worry about panic attacks and their conse-
quences, many individuals with panic disorder report constant or intermittent feelings of
anxiety that are more broadly related to heal th and mental health concerns. For example,
individuals with panic disorder often antici pate a catastrophic outc ome from a mild phys-
ical symptom or medication side effect (e.g., thinking that they may have heart disease or
that a headache means presence of a brain tumo r). Such individuals often are relatively in-
tolerant of medication side effects. In ad dition, there may be pe rvasive concerns about
abilities to complete daily tasks or withstand daily stressors, excessive use of drugs (e.g.,
alcohol, prescribed medications or illicit drugs)  to control panic attacks, or extreme behav-
iors aimed at controlling panic attacks (e.g., seve re restrictions on food intake or avoidance
of specific foods or medications because of concerns about physical symptoms that pro-
voke panic attacks). 
Prevalence
In the general population, the 12-month prevalen ce estimate for panic disorder across the
United States and several European countries is about 2%–3% in adults and adolescents. In
the United States, significantly lower rates of  panic disorder are reported among Latinos,
African Americans, Caribbean blacks, and As ian Americans, compared with non-Latino
whites; American Indians, by contrast, have significantly higher rates. Lower estimates
have been reported for Asian,  African, and Latin American countries, ranging from 0.1%
to 0.8%. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1. The
gender differentiation occurs in adolescence and is already observable before age 14 years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,255
"Although panic attacks occur in children, the overall prevalence  of panic disorder is low
before age 14 years (<0.4%). The rates of panic disorder show a gradua l increase during ad-
olescence, particularly in females, and possibly following the onset of puberty, and peak dur-
ing adulthood. The prevalence rates decline in older individuals (i.e., 0.7% in adults over
the age of 64), possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels. 
Development and Course
The median age at onset for panic disorder in the United States is 20–24 years. A small
number of cases begin in childhood, and onse t after age 45 years is unusual but can occur",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,255
"The usual course, if the disorder is untreated,  is chronic but waxing and waning. Some in-
dividuals may have episodic outbreaks with years of remission in between, and others
may have continuous severe symptomatology. Only a minority of individuals have full
remission without subsequent relapse within a few years. The course of panic disorder
typically is complicated by a range of other disorders, in particular other anxiety disor-
ders, depressive disorders, and substance us e disorders (see section “Comorbidity” for
this disorder). 
Although panic disorder is very rare in child hood, first occurrence of “fearful spells” is
often dated retrospectively back to childhood. As in adults, panic disorder in adolescents
tends to have a chronic course and is frequent ly comorbid with othe r anxiety, depressive,
and bipolar disorders. To date, no differences in the clinical presentation between adoles-
cents and adults have been fo und. However, adolescents may be less worried about addi-
tional panic attacks than are young adults. Lower prevalence of panic disorder in older
adults appears to be attributable to age- related “dampening” of the autonomic nervous
system response. Many older individuals with  “panicky feelings” are observed to have a
“hybrid” of limited-symptom panic attacks and generalized anxiety. Also, older adults",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,255
"Panic Disorder 211
tend to attribute their panic attacks to certai n stressful situations, such as a medical pro-
cedure or social setting. Older individuals may retrospectively endorse explanations for
the panic attack (which would preclude the diagnosis of panic disorder), even if an attack
might actually have been unexpected in the moment (and thus qualify as the basis for a
panic disorder diagnosis). This may result in under-endorsem ent of unexpected panic at-
tacks in older individuals. Thus, careful questioning of older adults is required to assess
whether panic attacks were expected before entering the situation,  so that unexpected
panic attacks and the diagnosis of panic disorder are not overlooked",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,256
"While the low rate of panic disorder in child ren could relate to difficulties in symptom
reporting, this seems unlikely given that child ren are capable of reporting intense fear or
panic in relation to separation and to phobic objects or phobic si tuations. Adolescents
might be less willing than adul ts to openly discuss panic a ttacks. Therefore, clinicians
should be aware that unexpected  panic attacks do occur in adolescents, much as they do in
adults, and be attuned to this possibility when encountering adolescents presenting with
episodes of intense fear or distress. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. Negative affectivity (neuroticism) (i .e., proneness to experiencing neg-
ative emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the disposition to believe that symptoms of
anxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the onset of panic attacks and, separately, for
worry about panic, although thei r risk status for the diagnosis of panic disorder is un-
known. History of “fearful spe lls” (i.e., limited-symptom atta cks that do not meet full cri-
teria for a panic attack) may be a risk factor for later panic attacks and panic disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,256
"Although separation anxiety in childhood, espe cially when severe, may precede the later
development of panic disorder, it is not a consistent risk factor. 
Environmental. Reports of childhood experiences of  sexual and physical abuse are more
common in panic disorder than in certain othe r anxiety disorders. Smoking is a risk factor
for panic attacks and panic disorder. Most individuals report identifiable stressors in the
months before their first panic attack (e.g., interpersonal stressors and stressors related to
physical well-being, such as negative experiences with illicit or prescription drugs, dis-
ease, or death in the family). 
Genetic and physiological. It is believed that multiple genes confer vulnerability to panic
disorder. However, the exact genes, gene prod ucts, or functions related to the genetic re-
gions implicated remain unknown. Current ne ural systems models for panic disorder em-
phasize the amygdala and related structures, mu ch as in other anxiety disorders. There is
an increased risk for panic d isorder among offspring of pare nts with anxiety, depressive,
and bipolar disorders. Respiratory disturbance, such as asthma, is associated with panic
disorder, in terms of past history, comorbidity, and family history. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
The rate of fears about mental and somatic symptoms of anxiety ap pears to vary across
cultures and may influence the rate of panic attacks and panic disorder. Also, cultural ex-
pectations may influence the classification of panic attacks as expected or unexpected. For
example, a Vietnamese individual who has a panic attack after walking out into a windy
environment ( trúng gió;  “hit by the wind”) may attribut e the panic attack to exposure to
wind as a result of the cultural  syndrome that links these two experiences, resulting in clas-
sification of the panic attack as expected. Various other cultural syndromes are associated
with panic disorder, including ataque de nervios  (“attack of nerves”) among Latin Ameri-
cans and khyâl  attacks and “soul loss” among Cambodians. Ataque de nervios  may involve
trembling, uncontrollable screaming or crying , aggressive or suicidal behavior, and deper-
sonalization or derealization, which may be ex perienced longer than the few minutes typical",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,256
"212 Anxiety Disorders
of panic attacks. Some c linical presentations of ataque de nervios  fulfill criteria for condi-
tions other than panic attack (e.g., other spec ified dissociative disorder). These syndromes
impact the symptoms and frequency of panic disorder, including the individual’s attribu-
tion of unexpectedness, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situations, rang-
ing from interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios), to types of exertion
(associated with khyâl  attacks), to atmospheri c wind (associated with trúng gió  attacks)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,257

"The specific worries about panic attacks or their consequences are likely to vary from
one culture to another (and across different age groups and gender). For panic disorder,
U.S. community samples of non- Latino whites have significantly less functional impair-
ment than African Americans. There are also hi gher rates of objectively defined severity in
non-Latino Caribbean blacks with panic disord er, and lower rates of panic disorder over-
all in both African American and Afro-Carib bean groups, suggesting that among individ-

substantial severity and impairment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,257

der and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in females only",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,257
"Diagnostic Markers
Agents with disparate mechanisms of action, such as sodium lactate, caffeine, isoprotere-
nol, yohimbine, carbon dioxide, and cholecys tokinin, provoke panic attacks in individuals
with panic disorder to a much greater extent than in healthy control subjects (and in some
cases, than in individuals with other anxiet y, depressive, or bipo lar disorders without
panic attacks). Also, for a proportion of indi viduals with panic disorder, panic attacks are
related to hypersensitive medullary carbon di oxide detectors, resulting in hypocapnia and
other respiratory irregularities . However, none of these labo ratory findings are consid-
ered diagnostic of panic disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,257
"Suicide Risk

order or unspecified anxiety disord er diagnosis should be considered",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,258
"Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. Panic disorder is not diagnosed if
the panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of another medical
condition. Examples of medica l conditions that can cause panic attacks include hyperthy-
roidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, vestibular  dysfunctions, seizure dis-
orders, and cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia,
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseas e [COPD]). Appropriate laboratory tests
(e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperparathy roidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or
physical examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in determining the eti-
ological role of another medical condition. 
Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Panic disorder is not diagnosed if
the panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a substance. In-
toxication with central nervou s system stimulants (e.g., co caine, amphetamines, caffeine)
or cannabis and withdraw al from central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol, bar-
biturates) can precipitate a panic attack. Howe ver, if panic attacks continue to occur out-
side of the context of substance use (e.g., long after the effects of intoxication or withdrawal
have ended), a diagnosis of panic disorder should be cons idered. In addition, because
panic disorder may precede substance use in some individuals and may be associated
with increased substance use, especially for pu rposes of self-medicat ion, a detailed history
should be taken to determine if the individual had panic at tacks prior to excessive sub-
stance use. If this is the case, a diagnosis of pa nic disorder should be considered in addition
to a diagnosis of substance use disorder. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the
presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness,
loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the possibility that an-
other medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,258
"Other mental disorders with panic attacks as an associated feature (e.g., other anxiety
disorders and psychotic disorders). Panic attacks that occur as a symptom of other anx-
iety disorders are expected (e.g., triggered by social situations in social anxiety disorder, by
phobic objects or situations in specific phobia  or agoraphobia, by worry in generalized anx-
iety disorder, by separation from home or atta chment figures in separation anxiety disorder)
and thus would not meet crit eria for panic disorder. ( Note: Sometimes an unexpected panic
attack is associated with the onset of another anxi ety disorder, but then the attacks become
expected, whereas panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks.) If
the panic attacks occur only in response to spec ific triggers, then only the relevant anxiety
disorder is assigned. However,  if the individual experiences unexpected panic attacks as
well and shows persistent concern and worry or  behavioral change because of the attacks,
then an additional diagnosis of pa nic disorder should be considered",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,258
"Comorbidity
Panic disorder infrequently occurs in clinic al settings in the absence of other psychopa-
thology. The prevalence of panic disorder is elevated in individuals with other disorders,
particularly other anxiety disorders (and espe cially agoraphobia), major depression, bipo-
lar disorder, and possibly mild alcohol use di sorder. While panic disorder often has an ear-
lier age at onset than the comorbid disorder(s), onset sometimes occurs after the comorbid
disorder and may be seen as a severi ty marker of the comorbid illness. 
Reported lifetime rates of comorbidity between major depressive disorder and panic
disorder vary widely, ranging from 10% to 65%  in individuals with panic disorder. In ap-
proximately one-third of indivi duals with both disorders, the depression precedes the on-
set of panic disorder. In the remaining two-th irds, depression occurs coincident with or
following the onset of panic disorder. A subset of individuals with panic disorder develop
a substance-related disorder, wh ich for some represents an a ttempt to treat their anxiety",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,258

with alcohol or medications. Comorbidity wi th other anxiety disorders and illness anxiety
disorder is also common. 
Panic disorder is significantly comorbid  with numerous general medical symptoms
and conditions, including, but not limited to, dizziness, ca rdiac arrhythmias, hyperthy-
roidism, asthma, COPD, and ir ritable bowel syndrome. However, the nature of the asso-
ciation (e.g., cause and effect) between pani c disorder and these conditions remains
unclear. Although mitral valve prolapse and thyroid disease are more common among in-
dividuals with panic disorder than in the ge neral population, the differences in prevalence
are not consistent",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,259

Note: Symptoms are presented for the purpose of identifying a panic attack; however,
panic attack is not a mental disorder and cannot be coded. Panic attacks can occur in the
context of any anxiety disorder as well as other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disor-
ders, posttraumatic stress disorder, substanc e use disorders) and some medical condi-
tions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal). When the presence of a panic
attack is identified, it should be noted as a specifier (e.g., “posttraumatic stress disorder
with panic attacks”). For panic disorder, the pr esence of panic attack is contained within
the criteria for the disorder and panic attack is not used as a specifier",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,259

The essential feature of a panic attack is an abru pt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort
that reaches a peak within minutes and during wh ich time four or more of 13 physical and cog-
nitive symptoms occur. Eleven of these 13 sy mptoms are physical (e.g., palpitations, sweat-
ing), while two are cognitive (i.e., fear of losing control or going crazy, fe ar of dying). “Fear of
going crazy” is a colloquialism often used by indivi duals with panic atta cks and is not in-
tended as a pejorative or diagnostic term. The term within minutes  means that the time to peak",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,259
"Panic Attack Specifier 215
intensity is literally only a few minutes. A panic attack can arise from either a calm state or an
anxious state, and time to peak intensity shou ld be assessed independently of any preceding
anxiety. That is, the start of the panic attack is the point at which there is an abrupt increase in
discomfort rather than the point at which anxiet y first developed. Likew ise, a panic attack can
return to either an anxious state or a calm stat e and possibly peak again. A panic attack is dis-
tinguished from ongoing anxiety by its time to pe ak intensity, which occurs within minutes; its
discrete nature; and its typically greater severity. Attacks that meet all other criteria but have
fewer than four physical and/or cogn itive symptoms are referred to as limited-symptom attacks.  
There are two characteristic types of pa nic attacks: expected and unexpected. Expected
panic attacks  are attacks for which there is an obvious cue or trigger, such as situations in
which panic attacks have typically occurred. Unexpected panic attacks  are those for which
there is no obvious cue or trigger at the time  of occurrence (e.g., wh en relaxing or out of
sleep [nocturnal panic attack]). The determination of whether panic attacks are expected
or unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on a combination
of careful questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the attack
and the individual’s own judgment of whether or not the attack seemed  to occur for no ap-
parent reason. Cultural interp retations may influence their determination as expected or
unexpected. Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncon-
trollable screaming or crying) may be seen; however, such symptoms  should not count as
one of the four required symptoms. Panic attacks can occur in the context of any mental
disorder (e.g., anxiety disorder s, depressive disorders, bipola r disorders, eating disorders,
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality di sorders, psychotic disorders,
substance use disorders) and some medical cond itions (e.g., cardiac,  respiratory, vestibu-
lar, gastrointestinal), with the majority ne ver meeting criteria for panic disorder. Recur-
rent unexpected panic attacks are requir ed for a diagnosis of panic disorder. 
Associated Features 
One type of unexpected panic attack is a nocturnal panic attack  (i.e., waking from sleep in a
state of panic), which differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep. Panic attacks
are related to a higher rate of  suicide attempts and suicidal ideation even when comorbid-
ity and other suicide risk fa ctors are taken into account",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,260
"Prevalence
In the general population, 12-month prevalen ce estimates for panic attacks in the United
States is 11.2% in adults. Twelve-month preval ence estimates do not appear to differ sig-
nificantly among African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos. Lower 12-month
prevalence estimates for European countries ap pear to range from 2.7% to 3.3%. Females
are more frequently affected than males, al though this gender difference is more pro-
nounced for panic disorder. Panic attacks can oc cur in children but are relatively rare until
the age of puberty, when the prevalence rates increase. The prevalence rates decline in
older individuals, possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,260
"Development and Course
The mean age at onset for panic attacks in the United States is approximately 22–23 years
among adults. However, the course of panic at tacks is likely influenced by the course of
any co-occurring mental disorder(s) and stre ssful life events. Panic attacks are uncommon,
and unexpected panic attacks are rare, in preadolescent children . Adolescents might be
less willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks, even though they present with ep-
isodes of intense fear or discom fort. Lower prevalence of pani c attacks in older individuals
may be related to a weaker autonomic response to emotional states re lative to younger in-
dividuals. Older individuals may be less inclin ed to use the word “fear” and more inclined",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,260
"216 Anxiety Disorders
to use the word “discomfort” to describe pa nic attacks. Older individuals with “panicky
feelings” may have a hybrid of limited-sym ptom attacks and generalized anxiety. In
addition, older individuals tend  to attribute panic attacks to  certain situations that are
stressful (e.g., medical procedures, social se ttings) and may retrospectively endorse expla-
nations for the panic attack even if it was un expected in the moment. This may result in un-
der-endorsement of unexpected panic attacks in older individuals. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Negative affectivity (neuroticism) (i .e., proneness to experiencing neg-
ative emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the disposition to believe that symptoms of
anxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the onset of panic attacks. History of “fearful
spells” (i.e., limited-symptom attacks that do not meet full criteria for a panic attack) may
be a risk factor for later panic attacks. 
Environmental. Smoking is a risk factor for panic atta cks. Most individu als report iden-
tifiable stressors in the months before their first panic attack (e.g., interpersonal stressors
and stressors related to physical well-being,  such as negative experiences with illicit or
prescription drugs, disease,  or death in the family). 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Cultural interpretations may in fluence the determination of panic attacks as expected or
unexpected. Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, and un-
controllable screaming or crying) may be seen ; however, such symptoms should not count
as one of the four required symptoms. Frequency of each of the 13 symptoms varies cross-
culturally (e.g., higher rates of paresthesias in African Americans and of dizziness in sev-
eral Asian groups). Cultural syndromes also influence the cross-cultural presentation of
panic attacks, resulting in different symptom profiles across different cultural groups. Ex-
amples include khyâl  (wind) attacks, a Cambodian cultural syndrome involving dizziness,
tinnitus, and neck soreness; and trúng gió  (wind-related) attacks,  a Vietnamese cultural
syndrome associated with headaches. Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves) is a cultural syn-
drome among Latin Americans that may invo lve trembling, uncontrollable screaming or
crying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and depersonalization or derealization, and which
may be experienced for longer than only a few minutes. Some clinical presentations of
ataque de nervios fulfill criteria for conditions other than panic attack (e.g., other specified
dissociative disorder). Also, cu ltural expectations may influe nce the classification of panic
attacks as expected or unexpected, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situa-
tions, ranging from interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios ), to types of
exertion (associated with khyâl attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with trúng gió  at-
tacks). Clarification of the details of cultural  attributions may aid in distinguishing ex-
pected and unexpected panic attacks. For more information ab out cultural syndromes, see

Functional Consequenc es of Panic Attacks
In the context of co-occurring mental disord ers, including anxiety disorders, depressive
disorders, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, psychoti c disorders, and personality
disorders, panic attacks are associated with  increased symptom severity, higher rates of
comorbidity and suicidality, and poorer trea tment response. Also, full-symptom panic at-
tacks typically are associated wi th greater morbidity (e.g., gr eater health care utilization,
more disability, poorer quality of life) than limited-symptom attacks. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other paroxysmal episodes (e.g., “anger attacks”). Panic attacks should not be diag-
nosed if the episodes do not involve the essent ial feature of an abrupt surge of intense fear
or intense discomfort, but rather other emotional states (e.g ., anger, grief)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,262
"Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. Medical conditions that can cause
or be misdiagnosed as panic attacks include hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheo-
chromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, se izure disorders, and cardiopulmonary con-
ditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular  tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease). Appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperpara-
thyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or  physical examinations (e.g., for cardiac con-
ditions) may be helpful in determining the etiological role of another medical condition. 
Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Intoxication with central nervous
system stimulants (e.g., coca ine, amphetamines, caffeine) or cannabis and withdrawal
from central nervous system depressants (e.g ., alcohol, barbiturat es) can precipitate a

attacks prior to excessiv e substance use. Features such as  onset after age 45 years or the
presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness,

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of agoraphobia is marked, or intense, fear or anxiety triggered by the
real or anticipated exposure to a wide range of situations (Criterion A). The diagnosis re-
quires endorsement of symptoms occurring in at least two of the following five situations:
1) using public transporation, such as automobiles, buses, trains, ships, or planes; 2) being
in open spaces, such as parking lots, marketplac es, or bridges; 3) being in enclosed spaces,
such as shops, theaters, or cine mas; 4) standing in line or being in a crowd; or 5) being out-
side of the home alone. The examples for each situation are not exha ustive; other situations
may be feared. When experienci ng fear and anxiety cued by such situations, individuals
typically experience thoughts that something terrible might happen (Criterion B). Individ-
uals frequently believe that esca pe from such situations might be difficult (e.g., “can’t get
out of here”) or that help might be unavaila ble (e.g., “there is nobody to help me”) when
panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms occur. “Panic-like
symptoms” refer to any of the 13 symptoms incl uded in the criteria for panic attack, such as
dizziness, faintness, and fear of dying. “Other incapacitating or  embarrassing symptoms”
include symptoms such as vomiting and inflammatory bowel symptoms, as well as, in
older adults, a fear of falling or, in children, a sense of disorientation and getting lost. 
The amount of fear experience d may vary with proximity to the feared situation and
may occur in anticipation of or  in the actual presence of the agoraphobic situation. Also,
the fear or anxiety may take the form of a full- or limited-symp tom panic attack (i.e., an ex-
pected panic attack). Fear or anxiety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into
contact with the feared situation (Criterion C). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious
only occasionally in an agoraphobic situation (e.g., becomes anxious when standing in line
on only one out of every five occasions) would not be diagnosed with agoraphobia. The in-
dividual actively avoids the situation or, if he or she either is unable or decides not to avoid
it, the situation evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Active avoidance  means the in-
dividual is currently behaving in ways that are intentionally designed to prevent or min-
imize contact with agoraphobi c situations. Avoidance can be behavioral (e.g., changing",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,263

daily routines, choosing a job nearby to avoi d using public transportation, arranging for
food delivery to avoid entering shops and su permarkets) as well as cognitive (e.g., using
distraction to get through agoraphobic situations) in nature. The avoidance can become so
severe that the person is completely homebound. Often, an individual is better able to con-
front a feared situation when accompanied by a companion, such as a partner, friend, or
health professional",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,264
"The fear, anxiety, or avoidance must be out of proportion to the actual danger posed by
the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocul tural context (Criterion E). Differentiating
clinically significant agoraphobic fears from  reasonable fears (e.g., leaving the house dur-
ing a bad storm) or from situations that ar e deemed dangerous (e.g ., walking in a parking
lot or using public transportation in a high-cri me area) is important for a number of reasons",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,264
"First, what constitutes av oidance may be difficul t to judge across cult ures and sociocultural
contexts (e.g., it is sociocultu rally appropriate for orthodox Muslim women in certain parts
of the world to avoid leaving the house alone,  and thus such avoidance would not be con-
sidered indicative of agoraphobia). Second, older adults are likely to overattribute their
fears to age-related constraints and are less likely to judge their fears as being out of pro-
portion to the actual risk. Th ird, individuals with agoraphobia are likely to overestimate
danger in relation to panic-like or other bodily symptoms. Agora phobia should be diag-
nosed only if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance pers ists (Criterion F) and if it causes clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of func-
tioning (Criterion G). Th e duration of “typically lasting for 6 months or more” is meant to
exclude individuals with short-lived, transien t problems. However, the duration criterion
should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
In its most severe forms, agoraphobia can ca use individuals to become completely home-
bound, unable to leave their home and dependent on others for services or assistance to pro-
vide even for basic needs. Demoralization and depressive symptoms, as well as abuse of
alcohol and sedative medication as inappropriate self-medication st rategies, are common. 
Prevalence
Every year approximately 1.7% of adolescents and adults have a diagnosis of agoraphobia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,264
"Females are twice as likely as males to expe rience agoraphobia. Agoraphobia may occur in
childhood, but incidence peaks in late ad olescence and early adulthood. Twelve-month
prevalence in individuals older than 65 year s is 0.4%. Prevalence rates do not appear to
vary systematically across cultural/racial groups",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,264
"Development and Course
The percentage of individuals with agorapho bia reporting panic attacks or panic disorder
preceding the onset of agoraphobia ranges fr om 30% in community samples to more than
50% in clinic samples. The majority of individuals with panic disorder show signs of anx-
iety and agoraphobia before the onset of panic disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,264
"In two-thirds of all cases of agoraphobia, initial onset is before age 35 years. There is a
substantial incidence risk in late adolescence and early adulthood, with indications for
a second high incidence risk phase after age 40 years. First onset in childhood is rare. The
overall mean age at onset for agoraphobia is 17 years, although the age at onset without
preceding panic attacks or panic disorder is 25–29 years. 
The course of agoraphobia is typically pers istent and chronic. Complete remission is
rare (10%), unless the agoraphobia is treated. With more severe agoraphobia, rates of full
remission decrease, whereas rates of relapse and chronicity increase. A range of other dis-
orders, in particular other anxiety disorders,  depressive disorders, substance use disor-
ders, and personality disorders, may complicat e the course of agoraphobia. The long-term",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,264

course and outcome of agoraphobia are associate d with substantially elevated risk of sec-
ondary major depressive disorder, persistent  depressive disorder (dysthymia), and sub-
stance use disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,265
"The clinical features of agoraphobia are rela tively consistent across the lifespan, although
the type of agoraphobic situations  triggering fear, anxiety, or avoidance, as well as the type of
cognitions, may vary. For example, in children, being outside of the home alone is the most fre-
quent situation feared, whereas in older adults, being in shops, standing in line, and being in
open spaces are most often feared. Also, cognitio ns often pertain to beco ming lost (in children),
to experiencing panic-like symptoms (in adults), to falling (in older adults)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,265
"The low prevalence of agoraphobia in childre n could reflect difficulties in symptom re-
porting, and thus assessments in young child ren may require solicitation of information
from multiple sources, includ ing parents or teachers. Adolescents, particularly males,
may be less willing than adults to openly discuss agoraphobic fears and avoidance; how-
ever, agoraphobia can occur prior to adulthood and should be assessed in children and
adolescents. In older adults, comorbid somatic symptom disord ers, as well as motor dis-
turbances (e.g., sense of fall ing or having medical compli cations), are frequently men-
tioned by individuals as the reason for their fear  and avoidance. In these instances, care is
to be taken in evaluating whether the fear and avoidance are out of proportion to the real
danger involved. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Behavioral inhibition and neurotic disposition (i.e., negative affectivity
[neuroticism] and anxiety sensit ivity) are closely associated with agoraphobia but are rel-
evant to most anxiety disorders (phobic disord ers, panic disorder, generalized anxiety dis-
order). Anxiety sensitivity (t he disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are
harmful) is also characteristic of individuals with agoraphobia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,265
"Environmental. Negative events in childhood (e.g., se paration, death of parent) and other
stressful events, such as being attacked or mugge d, are associated with the onset of agorapho-
bia. Furthermore, individuals with agoraphobia describe the family climate and child-rearing
behavior as being characterized by redu ced warmth and increased overprotection",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,265
"Genetic and physiological. Heritability for agoraphobia is 61%. Of the various phobias,
agoraphobia has the strongest and most specific association with the genetic factor that
represents proneness to phobias. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Females have different patterns of comorbid disorders than males. Consistent with gender
differences in the prevalence of mental diso rders, males have higher rates of comorbid
substance use disorders. 
Functional Consequences of Agoraphobia
Agoraphobia is associated with considerable  impairment and disability in terms of role
functioning, work productivity, and disability days. Agoraphobia severity is a strong de-
terminant of the degree of disab ility, irrespective of the pres ence of comorbid panic disor-
der, panic attacks, and other comorbid cond itions. More than one- third of individuals
with agoraphobia are completely homebound and unable to work. 
Differential Diagnosis 
When diagnostic criteria for agoraphobia and an other disorder are full y met, both diagnoses
should be assigned, unless the fear, anxiety, or av oidance of agoraphobia is  attributable to the
other disorder. Weighting of crit eria and clinical judgment may be helpful in some cases. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,265
"Agoraphobia 221
Specific phobia, situational type. Differentiating agoraphobia from situational specific
phobia can be challenging in some cases, because these conditions share several symptom
characteristics and criteria. Specific phobia, sit uational type, should be diagnosed versus ago-
raphobia if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is limited to one of the agoraphobic situations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,266
"Requiring fears from two or more of the agorapho bic situations is a robust means for differen-
tiating agoraphobia from specific phobias, partic ularly the situational subtype. Additional dif-
ferentiating features include the cognitive ideati on. Thus, if the situation is feared for reasons
other than panic-like symptoms or other incapaci tating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fears
of being directly harmed by the situation itself, such as fear of  the plane crashing for individ-
uals who fear flying), then a diagnosis of  specific phobia may be more appropriate. 
Separation anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety disorder can be best differentiated
from agoraphobia by examining cognitive ideation. In separation anxiety disorder, the
thoughts are about detachment from signific ant others and the home environment (i.e.,
parents or other attachment figures), whereas in agoraphobia the focus is on panic-like
symptoms or other incapacitating or embarr assing symptoms in the feared situations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,266
"Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Agoraphobia should be differentiated from so-
cial anxiety disorder based primarily on the si tuational clusters that trigger fear, anxiety,
or avoidance and the cognitive ideation. In soci al anxiety disorder, the focus is on fear of
being negatively evaluated. 
Panic disorder. When criteria for panic disorder are met, agoraphobia should not be di-
agnosed if the avoidance behaviors associated wi th the panic attacks do not extend to avoid-
ance of two or more agoraphobic situations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,266
"Acute stress disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. Acute stress disorder and
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be differentiated from agoraphobia by examin-
ing whether the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is related only to situations that remind the
individual of a traumatic event. If the fear, anxiety, or avoidanc e is restricted to trauma re-
minders, and if the avoidance behavior does not extend to two or more agoraphobic situ-
ations, then a diagnosis of agoraphobia is not warranted. 
Major depressive disorder. In major depressive disorder, the individual may avoid leav-
ing home because of apathy, loss of energy, low self-esteem, and anhe donia. If the avoid-
ance is unrelated to fears of panic-like or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms,
then agoraphobia should not be diagnosed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,266
"Other medical conditions. Agoraphobia is not diagnosed if the avoidance of situations
is judged to be a physiological consequence of  a medical condition. This determination is
based on history, laboratory findings, and a physical examination. Other relevant medical
conditions may include neurod egenerative disorders with associated moto r disturbances
(e.g., Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis), as well as cardiovascular disorders. Individ-
uals with certain medical conditions may av oid situations because of realistic concerns
about being incapacitate d (e.g., fainting in an individual  with transient ischemic attacks)
or being embarrassed (e.g., diarrhea in an individual with Crohn’s disease). The diagnosis
of agoraphobia should be given only when the fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that
usually associated with these medical conditions. 
Comorbidity
The majority of individuals with agoraphobia also have other mental  disorders. The most
frequent additional diagnoses are other anxiety disorders (e.g., specific phobias, panic dis-
order, social anxiety disorder), depressive disorders (major depre ssive disorder), PTSD,
and alcohol use disorder. Where as other anxiety disorders (e.g., separation anxiety disor-
der, specific phobias, panic disorder) frequent ly precede onset of agoraphobia, depressive
disorders and substance use disorders ty pically occur secondary to agoraphobia.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,266

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of generalized anxiety disorder is excessive anxiety and worry (ap-
prehensive expectation) about a number of events or activities. The intensity, duration, or
frequency of the anxiety and worry is out of pr oportion to the actual likelihood or impact
of the anticipated event. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry and to keep
worrisome thoughts from interfering with attention to tasks at hand. Adults with gener-
alized anxiety disorder often worry about everyday, routine life circumstances, such as
possible job responsibilities, health and fina nces, the health of family members, misfor-
tune to their children, or minor matters (e.g.,  doing household chores or being late for ap-
pointments). Children with generalized anxiet y disorder tend to worry excessively about
their competence or the quality of their perf ormance. During the co urse of the disorder,
the focus of worry may shift from one concern to another",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,267

more pervasive, pronounced, and distressing; have longer du ration; and frequently occur
without precipitants. The greater the range of life circumstances about which a person
worries (e.g., finances, children’s safety, job performance), the more likely his or her symp-
toms are to meet criteria for generalized anxi ety disorder. Third, everyday worries are much
less likely to be accompanied by physical symp toms (e.g., restlessness or feeling keyed up
or on edge). Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report subjective distress due
to constant worry and related impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,268
"The anxiety and worry are accompanied by at  least three of the following additional
symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or  on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty
concentrating or mind going bl ank, irritability, muscle tens ion, and disturbed sleep, al-
though only one additional symptom is required in children. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Associated with muscle tension, there may be  trembling, twitching, feeling shaky, and
muscle aches or soreness. Many individuals wi th generalized anxiety disorder also expe-
rience somatic symptoms (e.g., sweating, naus ea, diarrhea) and an exaggerated startle re-
sponse. Symptoms of autonomic hyperarousal  (e.g., accelerated heart rate, shortness of
breath, dizziness) are less prominent in genera lized anxiety disorder than in other anxiety
disorders, such as panic disorder. Other conditions that may be associated with stress (e.g.,
irritable bowel syndrome, headaches) frequently accompany generalized anxiety disorder. 
Prevalence
The 12-month prevalence of generalized anxiet y disorder is 0.9% among adolescents and
2.9% among adults in the general communit y of the United Stat es. The 12-month preva-
lence for the disorder in other countries ranges from 0.4% to 3.6%. The lifetime morbid risk
is 9.0%. Females are twice as likely as males to  experience generalized  anxiety disorder. The
prevalence of the diagnosis peak s in middle age and declines across the later years of life",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,268
"Individuals of European descent tend to ex perience generalized anxiety disorder more
frequently than do individuals of non-Euro pean descent (i.e., Asian, African, Native

more likely than individuals from nondeveloped  countries to report that they have expe-
rienced symptoms that meet criteria for ge neralized anxiety disorder in their lifetime",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,268
"Development and Course
Many individuals with generalized anxiety disord er report that they have felt anxious and
nervous all of their lives. The median age at  onset for generalized anxiety disorder is 30
years; however, age at onset is spread over a very broad range. The median age at onset is
later than that for the other anxiety disorder s. The symptoms of excessive worry and anx-
iety may occur early in life but are then ma nifested as an anxious temperament. Onset of
the disorder rarely occurs prior to adolesce nce. The symptoms of generalized anxiety dis-
order tend to be chronic and wax and wane across the lifespan, fluctuating between syn-

elderly. In the frail elderly, worries abou t safety—and especially about falling—may limit

ries often concern the quality of  their performance or competen ce at school or in sporting

cessive concerns about punctuality. They ma y also worry about ca tastrophic events, such
as earthquakes or nuclear war. Children with  the disorder may be overly conforming, per-
fectionist, and unsure of themselves and tend to redo tasks because of excessive dissatis-
faction with less-than-perfect  performance. They are typi cally overzealous in seeking

cial anxiety disorder (social phobia), and obsessive-compulsive disorder are often accom-
panied by worries that may mimic those described in generalized anxiety disorder. For

"Differential Diagnosis
Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis of anxiety disorder
associated with another medical condition should be assigned if the individual’s anxiety
and worry are judged, based on history, labora tory findings, or physical examination, to
be a physiological effect of another specific medical condition (e.g., pheochromocytoma,
hyperthyroidism).

anxiety disorder is distinguished from generaliz ed anxiety disorder by the fact that a sub-

coffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced anxiety disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,270
"Social anxiety disorder. Individuals with social anxiety disorder often have anticipa-
tory anxiety that is focused on upcoming social situations in which they must perform or
be evaluated by others, whereas individuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry,
whether or not they are being evaluated. 
Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Several features distinguish the excessive worry of
generalized anxiety disorder fr om the obsessional thoughts of obsessive-compulsive dis-
order. In generalized anxiety disorder the focus of the worry is about forthcoming prob-
lems, and it is the excessivene ss of the worry about future events that is abnormal. In
obsessive-compulsive disorder, the obsessions are inappropriate ideas that take the form of
intrusive and unwanted thou ghts, urges, or images. 
Posttraumatic stress disorder  and adjustment disorders. Anxiety is invariably pres-
ent in posttraumatic stress disorder. Generali zed anxiety disorder is not diagnosed if the
anxiety and worry are better explained by sy mptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,270

Individuals whose presen tation meets criteria for genera lized anxiety disorder are likely
to have met, or currently meet, criteria for other anxiety and unip olar depressive disor-

associated with temperamental antecedents and genetic and environmental risk factors

the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms
persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of
acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the
existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder

Note:  This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or
substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical
picture and they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. 
Coding note:  The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medica-

code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for
the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-
stance-induced anxiety disorder, the 4th positio n character is “1,” and the clinician should
record “mild [substance] use disorder” bef ore the substance-induced anxiety disorder
(e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocai ne-induced anxiety disorder”). If a moderate or
severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced anxiety disorder,
the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use
disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid
substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,271

"Diagnostic Features
The essential features of substance/medicati on-induced anxiety di sorder are prominent
symptoms of panic or anxiety (Criterion A) that  are judged to be due to the effects of a sub-
stance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or  a toxin exposure). The panic or anxiety symp-
toms must have developed duri ng or soon after substance in toxication or withdrawal or
after exposure to a medication, and the substa nces or medications must be capable of pro-
ducing the symptoms (Criteri on B2). Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder
due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition must
have its onset while the individual is receivin g the medication (or during withdrawal, if a
withdrawal is associated with the medication ). Once the treatment is discontinued, the
panic or anxiety symptoms will usually improv e or remit within days to several weeks to
a month (depending on the half-life of the su bstance/medication and the presence of with-
drawal). The diagnosis of substance/medicati on-induced anxiety disorder should not be
given if the onset of the panic or anxiety symptoms precedes the substance/medication in-
toxication or withdrawal, or if the symptoms persist for a subs tantial period of time (i.e.,
usually longer than 1 month) from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the
panic or anxiety symptoms persist for substantial periods of time, other causes for the
symptoms should be considered",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,273

lants (including cocaine), and other (or unknown) substances. Panic or anxiety can occur in
association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sed-
atives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants  (including cocaine); and other (or unknown)
substances. Some medications that evoke anxi ety symptoms include anesthetics and anal-
gesics, sympathomimetics or other bronchodilato rs, anticholiner gics, insulin, thyroid prep-
arations, oral contraceptives, antihistamines, antiparkinsonian medica tions, corticosteroids,
antihypertensive and ca rdiovascular medications, anticon vulsants, lithium carbonate, an-
tipsychotic medications, and antidepressant medications. Heavy metals and toxins (e.g.,
organophosphate insecticide, nerve gases, ca rbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, volatile sub-
stances such as gasoline and paint) may also cause panic or anxiety symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,274
"Prevalence
The prevalence of substance/me dication-induced anxiety disorder is not clear. General
population data suggest that it may be rare, with a 12-month prevalence of approximately
0.002%. However, in clinical populations,  the prevalence is likely to be higher. 
Diagnostic Markers
Laboratory assessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may be useful  to measure substance intox-
ication as part of an assessment for subs tance/medication-induced anxiety disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,274
"Differential Diagnosis
Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. Anxiety symptoms commonly oc-
cur in substance intoxi cation and substance withdrawal. The diagnosis of the substance-
specific intoxication or substance-specific wi thdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the
symptom presentation. A diag nosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder
should be made in addition to  substance intoxication or su bstance withdrawal when the
panic or anxiety symptoms are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently se-
vere to warrant independent c linical attention. For example, panic or anxiety symptoms
are characteristic of alcohol withdrawal. 
Anxiety disorder (i.e., not indu ced by a substance/medication). Substance/medication-
induced anxiety disorder is judged to be etio logically related to the substance/medication",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,274
"Substance/medication-induced anxiety disord er is distinguished from a primary anxiety
disorder based on the onset, course, and othe r factors with respect to substances/medica-
tions. For drugs of abuse, there must be eviden ce from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings for use,  intoxication, or withdrawal . Substance/medication-induced
anxiety disorders arise only in association with  intoxication or with drawal states, whereas
primary anxiety disorders may precede the onse t of substance/medication use. The pres-
ence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder, such as atypical age at onset
(e.g., onset of panic disorder after age 45 year s) or symptoms (e.g., atypical panic attack
symptoms such as true vertigo, loss of balanc e, loss of consciousness , loss of bladder con-
trol, headaches, slurred speech) may suggest a substance/medication -induced etiology. A
primary anxiety disorder diagnosis is warranted if the panic or anxiety symptoms persist
for a substantial period of time (about 1 mont h or longer) after the end of the substance in-
toxication or acute withdr awal or there is a histor y of an anxiety disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,274

tion is the causative agent (in which case  the symptoms may be better explained by
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder).  If the disturbance is  attributable to both
another medical condition and substance use, bo th diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to
another medical condition and substance/me dication-induced anxi ety disorder) may be
given. When there is insufficie nt evidence to determine whether the panic or anxiety symp-
toms are attributable to a subs tance/medication or to anothe r medical condition or are pri-

hensive assessment of multiple factors is ne cessary to make this judgment. Several aspects
of the clinical presentation should be consider ed: 1) the presence of a clear temporal asso-
ciation between the onset, exacerbation, or re mission of the medical condition and the anx-
iety symptoms; 2) the presence of features th at are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder
(e.g., atypical age at onset or course); and 3) evidence in the literature that a known phys-
iological mechanism (e.g., hyperthyroidism) ca uses anxiety. In addi tion, the disturbance
must not be better explained by a primar y anxiety disorder, a substance/medication-
induced anxiety disorder, or an other primary mental disorder (e.g., adjustment disorder). 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
A number of medical conditions are known to  include anxiety as a symptomatic manifes-
tation. Examples include endocrine disease (e.g., hyperthyroidis m, pheochromocytoma,
hypoglycemia, hyperadrenocortisolism), cardiovascular disorders (e.g., congestive heart
failure, pulmonary embolism, arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation), respiratory illness
(e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary diseas e, asthma, pneumonia), metabolic distur-
bances (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency, porphyria), and neurological illness (e.g., neoplasms,
vestibular dysfunction, encephalitis, seizure disorders). Anxiety due to another medical
condition is diagnosed when the medical cond ition is known to induce anxiety and when
the medical condition preceded the onset of the anxiety",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,276
"Prevalence
The prevalence of anxiety disorder due to an other medical condition is unclear. There ap-
pears to be an elevated prevalence of anxi ety disorders among individuals with a variety
of medical conditions, including asthma, hypert ension, ulcers, and arthritis. However, this
increased prevalence may be due to reasons ot her than the anxiety disorder directly caus-
ing the medical condition. 
Development and Course
The development and course of anxiety diso rder due to another medical condition gen-
erally follows the course of the underlying illness. This diagnosis is not meant to include
primary anxiety disorders that arise in the co ntext of chronic medical illness. This is im-
portant to consider with older adults, who may experience chronic medical illness and
then develop independent anxiety disorder s secondary to the chronic medical illness",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,276

a substance, or exposure to a toxin, a su bstance/medication-induced anxiety disorder
should be considered. Certain medications are known to increase anxiety (e.g., corticoste-
roids, estrogens, metoclopramide), and when this is the case, the medication may be the
most likely etiology, although it may be difficult to distinguish whether the anxiety is at-
tributable to the medications or to the medica l illness itself. When a diagnosis of substance-
induced anxiety is being made in relation to recreational or nonprescribed drugs, it may be
useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen  or other appropriate laboratory evaluation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,277
"Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks of) substance intoxication
or withdrawal or after medication use may be  especially indicative of a substance/medi-
cation-induced anxiety disorder, depending on  the type, duration, or amount of the sub-
stance used. If the disturbance is associate d with both another medical condition and
substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to anothe r medical condition and
substance/medication-induced an xiety disorder) can be given. Features such as onset af-
ter age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo,
loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowe l control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest
the possibility that another medical condition or  a substance may be causing the panic at-
tack symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,277
"Anxiety disorder (not due to a known medical condition). Anxiety disorder due to an-
other medical condition should be distinguis hed from other anxiety disorders (especially
panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder). In other anxiety disorders, no specific
and direct causative physiological mechanisms  associated with anot her medical condition
can be demonstrated. Late age at onset, atyp ical symptoms, and the absence of a personal
or family history of anxiety disorders suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule
out the diagnosis of anxiety diso rder due to another medical condition. Anxiety disorders
can exacerbate or pose increased risk for me dical conditions such as cardiovascular events
and myocardial infarction and should not be diagnosed as anxiety disorder due to another
medical condition in these cases",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,277
"Illness anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorder due to anothe r medical condition should be
distinguished from illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by
worry about illness, concern about pain, and bod ily preoccupations. In the case of illness
anxiety disorder, individuals may or may not have diagnosed medical conditions. Al-
though an individual with illness anxiety di sorder and a diagnose d medical condition is
likely to experience anxiety about the medical condition, the medical condition is not
physiologically related to the anxiety symptoms. 
Adjustment disorders. Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be
distinguished from adjustment disorders, with anxiety, or with anxiety and depressed
mood. Adjustment diso rder is warranted when individual s experience a maladaptive re-
sponse to the stress of having another medical condition. The reaction to stress usually
concerns the meaning or consequences of the stress, as compared with the experience of
anxiety or mood symptoms that occur as a phy siological consequence of the other medical
condition. In adjustment disorder, the anxi ety symptoms are typically related to coping
with the stress of having a general medical condition, whereas in anxiety disorder due to
another medical condition, individuals are more likely to have prominent physical symp-
toms and to be focused on issues other than the stress of the illness itself.

ated feature of another ment al disorder (e.g., schizo phrenia, anorexia nervosa).

"OCD is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions
are recurrent and persistent th oughts, urges, or images that are experienced as intrusive
and unwanted, whereas compulsions  are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an indi-
vidual feels driven to perform in response to  an obsession or according to rules that must
be applied rigidly. Some other obsessive-comp ulsive and related disorders are also char-
acterized by preoccupations and by repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to the
preoccupations. Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are characterized pri-
marily by recurrent body -focused repetitive behaviors (e.g.,  hair pulling, sk in picking) and
repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviors",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,280
"The inclusion of a chapter on  obsessive-compulsive and rela ted disorders in DSM-5 re-
flects the increasing evidence of these disorders’ relatedness to one an other in terms of a
range of diagnostic validators as well as the c linical utility of grouping these disorders in
the same chapter. Clinicians are encouraged to  screen for these cond itions in individuals
who present with one of them and be aware of overlaps between these conditions. At the
same time, there are important differences in  diagnostic validators and treatment ap-
proaches across these disorders. Moreover, there are close relationships between the anx-
iety disorders and some of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (e.g., OCD),
which is reflected in the sequence of DSM-5 chapters, with obsessive-compulsive and re-
lated disorders following anxiety disorders. 
The obsessive-compulsive and related diso rders differ from developmentally norma-
tive preoccupations and rituals by being exce ssive or persisting beyond developmentally
appropriate periods. The distinction between the presence of subclinical symptoms and a
clinical disorder requires assessment of a nu mber of factors, including the individual’s
level of distress and impa irment in functioning. 
The chapter begins with OCD. It then co vers body dysmorphic disorder and hoarding
disorder, which are characterized by cognit ive symptoms such as perceived defects or
flaws in physical appearance or the perceived need to save possessions, respectively. The
chapter then covers trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking)
disorder, which are characterized by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors. Finally,
it covers substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive an d related disorder,
obsessive-compulsive and relate d disorder due to another me dical condition, and other

sive and related disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,280

sexual, and religious obsessions and related co mpulsions); and harm (e .g., fears of harm to
oneself or others and related checking comp ulsions). The tic-related specifier of OCD is
used when an individual has a curren t or past history of a tic disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,281
"Body dysmorphic disorder is characterize d by preoccupation with one or more per-
ceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear only slight
to others, and by repetitive  behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin
picking, or reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing one’s appearance with that
of other people) in response to the appear ance concerns. The appearance preoccupations
are not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual with an eat-
ing disorder. Muscle dysmorphia is a form of body dysmorphic disord er that is character-
ized by the belief that one’s body build is too small or is insu fficiently muscular",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,281
"Hoarding disorder is characterized by persis tent difficulty discarding or parting with
possessions, regardless of their actual value, as a result of a strong perceived need to save
the items and to distress associated with disc arding them. Hoarding disorder differs from
normal collecting. For example, symptoms of hoarding disorder result in the accumula-
tion of a large number of possessions that co ngest and clutter active living areas to the ex-
tent that their intended use is substantially  compromised. The excessive acquisition form
of hoarding disorder, which characterizes most  but not all individuals with hoarding dis-
order, consists of excessive collecting, buying , or stealing of items that are not needed or
for which there is no available space",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,281
"Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) is characterized by recurrent pulling out of
one's hair resulting in hair loss, and repeated  attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,281
"Excoriation (skin-picking) disord er is characterized by recurrent picking of one’s skin re-
sulting in skin lesions and repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking. The body-
focused repetitive behaviors that characterize  these two disorders are not triggered by ob-
sessions or preoccupations; however, they ma y be preceded or accompanied by various
emotional states, such as feelin gs of anxiety or boredom. They may also be preceded by an
increasing sense of tension or may lead to gr atification, pleasure, or  a sense of relief when
the hair is pulled out or the skin is picked. In dividuals with these disorders may have vary-
ing degrees of conscious awareness of the beha vior while engaging in it, with some indi-
viduals displaying more focused attention on  the behavior (with preceding tension and
subsequent relief) and other individuals displaying more automatic behavior (with the be-
haviors seeming to occur without full awareness)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,281
"Substance/medication-i nduced obsessive-compulsive an d related disorder consists of

Specifiers
Many individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have dysfunctional beliefs",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,283
"These beliefs can include an inflated sense of responsibility and the tendency to overesti-
mate threat; perfectionism and intolerance of uncertainty; an d over-importance of thoughts
(e.g., believing that having a fo rbidden thought is as bad as acting on it) and the need to
control thoughts. 
Individuals with OCD vary in the degree of insight they have about the accuracy of the
beliefs that underlie their obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Many individuals have good or
fair insight  (e.g., the individual believes that the house definitely will not, probably will not,
or may or may not burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times). Some have poor insight
(e.g., the individual believes that the house w ill probably burn down if the stove is not
checked 30 times), and a few (4% or less) have absent insight/delu sional beliefs  (e.g., the in-
dividual is convinced that the house will burn down if the stove is not checked 30 times)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,283
"Insight can vary within an individual over the course of the illness. Poorer insight has been
linked to worse long-term outcome",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,283
"Up to 30% of individuals with OCD have a lifetime tic disorder. This is most common
in males with onset of OCD in childhood. Thes e individuals tend to differ from those with-
out a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD sy mptoms, comorbidity, course,
and pattern of fam ilial transmission. 
Diagnostic Features
The characteristic symptoms of OCD are the pr esence of obsessions and compulsions (Cri-
terion A). Obsessions  are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images
(e.g., of violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone) . Importantly, obsessions
are not pleasurable or experi enced as voluntary: they ar e intrusive and unwanted and
cause marked distress or anxiety in most indi viduals. The individual attempts to ignore or
suppress these obsessions (e.g., avoiding tri ggers or using thought suppression) or to neu-
tralize them with another thought or ac tion (e.g., performing a compulsion). Compulsions
(or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g., counting,
repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an
obsession or according to rules that must be  applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD
have both obsessions and compulsions. Comp ulsions are typically performed in response
to an obsession (e.g., thoughts of contaminatio n leading to washing rituals or that some-
thing is incorrect leading to repeating rituals unt il it feels “just right”). The aim is to reduce
the distress triggered by obsessions or to pr event a feared event (e.g., becoming ill). How-
ever, these compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g.,
arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm  to a loved one) or are clearly excessive
(e.g., showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some
individuals experience relief from anxiety or distress. 
Criterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (e.g.,
more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment to warrant
a diagnosis of OCD. This criterion helps to distinguish the disorder from the occasional in-
trusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that  are common in the general population (e.g.,
double-checking that a door is locked). The frequency and severity of obsessions and com-
pulsions vary across individuals with OCD (e.g., some have mild to moderate symptoms,
spending 1–3 hours per day obsessing or doin g compulsions, where as others have nearly
constant intrusive thoughts or comp ulsions that can be  incapacitating)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,283
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
The specific content of obsessions and comp ulsions varies between individuals. However,
certain themes, or dimensions, are common, including those of cleaning (contamination
obsessions and cleaning compulsions); sy mmetry (symmetry obsess ions and repeating,",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,283
"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 239
ordering, and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo th oughts (e.g., aggressive, sexual,
or religious obsessions and related compulsions) ; and harm (e.g., fears of harm to oneself
or others and checking compulsions). Some individuals also  have difficulties discarding
and accumulate (hoard) object s as a consequence of typical obsessions and compulsions,
such as fears of harming othe rs. These themes occur across different cultures, are rela-
tively consistent over time in adults with th e disorder, and may be as sociated with differ-
ent neural substrates. Importantly, individu als often have symptoms  in more than one
dimension. 
Individuals with OCD experience a range of  affective responses when confronted with
situations that trigger obsessions and compul sions. For example, many individuals expe-
rience marked anxiety that can include recurren t panic attacks. Others report strong feel-
ings of disgust. While perfor ming compulsions, some individuals report a distressing
sense of “incompleteness” or uneasiness unt il things look, feel, or sound “just right.” 
It is common for individuals with the disorder to avoid people, places, and things that
trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, individuals with contamination con-
cerns might avoid public situat ions (e.g., restaurants, public  restrooms) to reduce ex-
posure to feared contaminants; individuals with intrusive thoughts about causing harm
might avoid social interactions. 
Prevalence
The 12-month prevalence of OCD in the United St ates is 1.2%, with a similar prevalence in-
ternationally (1.1%–1.8%). Females are affected  at a slightly higher rate than males in
adulthood, although males are more commonly affected in childhood. 
Development and Course
In the United States, the mean age at onset of OCD is 19.5 years, and 25% of cases start by
age 14 years. Onset after age 35 years is unusual but does occur. Males have an earlier age
at onset than females: nearly 25% of males have onset before age 10 years. The onset of
symptoms is typically gradual; however,  acute onset has also been reported",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,284
"If OCD is untreated, the cour se is usually chronic, often with waxing and waning symp-
toms. Some individuals have an episodic course, and a minority have a deteriorating
course. Without treatment, remission rates in  adults are low (e.g., 20% for those reevalu-
ated 40 years later). Onset in childhood or adolescence can le ad to a lifetim e of OCD. How-
ever, 40% of individuals with onset of OCD in childhood or adolescence may experience
remission by early adulthood. The course of OCD is often complicated by the co-occurrence
of other disorders (see section “C omorbidity” for this disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,284
"Compulsions are more easily diagnosed in  children than obsessions are because com-
pulsions are observable. However, most childr en have both obsessions and compulsions
(as do most adults). The pattern  of symptoms in adults can be stable over time, but it is
more variable in children. Some differences in the content of obsessions and compulsions
have been reported when children and adol escent samples have been compared with
adult samples. These differences likely refl ect content appropriate to different develop-
mental stages (e.g., higher rates of sexual an d religious obsessions in adolescents than in
children; higher rates of harm obsessions [e.g ., fears of catastrophic events, such as death
or illness to self or loved ones] in ch ildren and adolescents than in adults). 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. Greater internalizing symptoms, hi gher negative emotionality, and
behavioral inhibition in childhood are possible temperamental risk factors. 
Environmental. Physical and sexual abuse in childho od and other stressful or traumatic
events have been associated with an increased risk for de veloping OCD. Some children",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,284

may develop the sudden onset of obsessive- compulsive symptoms, which has been asso-
ciated with different environmental factors,  including various infectious agents and a
post-infectious auto immune syndrome",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,285
"Genetic and physiological. The rate of OCD among first-degree relatives of adults with
OCD is approximately two times that among fi rst-degree relatives of those without the
disorder; however, among first-degree relatives of individuals with onset of OCD in child-
hood or adolescence, the rate is increased 10-fold. Familial transmission is due in part to
genetic factors (e.g., a concordance rate of 0.57  for monozygotic vs. 0.22  for dizygotic twins)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,285
"Dysfunction in the orbitofrontal cortex, anteri or cingulate cortex, and striatum have been
most strongly implicated",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,285
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
OCD occurs across the world. There is substant ial similarity across cultures in the gender
distribution, age at onset, and comorbidity of OCD. Moreover, around the globe, there is a
similar symptom structure in volving cleaning, symmetry, hoarding, taboo thoughts, or
fear of harm. However, regional variation in symptom expression exists, and cultural
factors may shape the content of obsessions and compulsions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,285
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Males have an earlier age at onset of OCD than females and are more likely to have co-
morbid tic disorders. Gender differences in the pattern of symptom dimensions have been
reported, with, for example, females more likel y to have symptoms in the cleaning dimen-
sion and males more likely to have symptoms in the forbidden thoughts and symmetry di-
mensions. Onset or exacerbation of OCD, as well as symptoms that can interfere with the
mother-infant relationship (e.g., aggressive ob sessions leading to avoidance of the infant),
have been reported in the peripartum period. 
Suicide Risk
Suicidal thoughts occur at some point in as many as about half of individuals with OCD",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,285
"Suicide attempts are also report ed in up to one-quarter of individuals with OCD; the pres-
ence of comorbid major depressiv e disorder increases the risk. 
Functional Consequences of 
Obsessive-Compu lsive Disorder
OCD is associated with reduced quality of life as  well as high levels of social and occupa-
tional impairment. Impairment occurs across many different domains of life and is asso-
ciated with symptom severity. Impairment can be caused by the time spent obsessing and
doing compulsions. Avoi dance of situations that can tr igger obsessions or compulsions
can also severely restrict functioning. In addition, specific sympto ms can create specific
obstacles. For example, obsessions about harm can make relationships with family and
friends feel hazardous; the result can be av oidance of these rela tionships. Obsessions
about symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or work projects because the
project never feels “just right,” potentially resulting in school failure or job loss. Health
consequences can also occur. For example, individuals with contamination concerns may
avoid doctors’ offices and hospit als (e.g., because of fears of exposure to germs) or develop
dermatological problems (e.g., skin lesion s due to excessive washing). Sometimes the
symptoms of the disorder inte rfere with its own treatment (e .g., when medications are con-
sidered contaminated). When th e disorder starts in childhood  or adolescence, individuals
may experience developmental difficulties. Fo r example, adolescents may avoid socializ-
ing with peers; young adults may struggle when they leave home to live independently.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,285
"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 241
The result can be few significant relationship s outside the family and a lack of autonomy
and financial independence from their family of origin. In addition, some individuals with
OCD try to impose rules and prohibitions on  family members beca use of their disorder
(e.g., no one in the family can have visitors to the house for fear of contamination), and this
can lead to family dysfunction. 
Differential Diagnosis
Anxiety disorders. Recurrent thoughts, avoidant behavi ors, and repetitive requests for
reassurance can also occur in anxiety disorders. Ho wever, the recurrent thoughts that are
present in generalized anxiety disorder (i.e., worries) are usually ab out real-life concerns,
whereas the obsessions of OCD usually do no t involve real-life concerns and can include
content that is odd, irrational, or of a se emingly magical nature; moreover, compulsions
are often present and usually linked to the obsessions. Like individuals with OCD, indi-
viduals with specific phobia can have a fear re action to specific objects or situations; how-
ever, in specific phobia the feared object is usually much more circ umscribed, and rituals
are not present. In social anxiety disorder (social phobia), the feared objects or situations
are limited to social interactions, and avoida nce or reassurance seeking is focused on re-
ducing this social fear",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,286
"Major depressive disorder. OCD can be distinguished from the rumination of major
depressive disorder, in whic h thoughts are usually mood-c ongruent and not necessarily
experienced as intrusive or distressing; mo reover, ruminations are not linked to compul-
sions, as is typical in OCD. 
Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. In body dysmorphic disorder, the
obsessions and compulsions are limited to concerns about physical appearance; and in
trichotillomania (hair-pulling diso rder), the compulsive behavior is limited to hair pulling
in the absence of obsessions. Hoarding diso rder symptoms focus exclusively on the per-
sistent difficulty discarding or parting with  possessions, marked distress associated with
discarding items, and excessive accumulation of  objects. However, if an individual has ob-
sessions that are typical of OCD (e.g., concer ns about incompleteness or harm), and these
obsessions lead to compulsive hoarding behaviors (e.g., acquirin g all objects in a set to at-
tain a sense of completeness or not discarding old newspape rs because they may contain
information that could prevent harm), a di agnosis of OCD should be given instead. 
Eating disorders. OCD can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa in that in OCD the
obsessions and compulsions are not limite d to concerns about weight and food",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,286
"Tics (in tic disorder) and stereotyped movements. A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent,
nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e.g., eye blinking, th roat clearing). A ste-
reotyped movement  is a repetitive, seemingly driven, nonfunctional motor behavior (e.g.,
head banging, body rocking,  self-biting). Tics and ster eotyped movements are typically
less complex than compulsions and are not aimed at neutralizing obsessions. However,
distinguishing between complex tics and comp ulsions can be difficult. Whereas compul-
sions are usually preceded by obsessions, tics  are often preceded by premonitory sensory
urges. Some individuals have symptoms of both OCD and a tic disorder, in which case
both diagnoses may be warranted. 
Psychotic disorders. Some individuals with OCD have poor insight or even delusional
OCD beliefs. However, they have obsessions and compulsions (disting uishing their
condition from delusional diso rder) and do not have other features of schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder (e.g., hallucinations or formal thought disorder). 
Other compulsive-like behaviors. Certain behaviors are sometimes described as “com-
pulsive,” including sexual behavior (in the ca se of paraphilias), ga mbling (i.e., gambling",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,286
"242 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders
disorder), and substance use (e.g., alcohol us e disorder). However, these behaviors differ
from the compulsions of OCD in that the pers on usually derives pleasure from the activity
and may wish to resist it only beca use of its deleterious consequences",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,287
"Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Although obsessive-compulsive person-
ality disorder and OCD have similar names, the clinical manifestations of these disorders
are quite different. Obsessive- compulsive personality disorder is not characterized by in-
trusive thoughts, images, or ur ges or by repetitive behavior s that are performed in re-
sponse to these intrusions; instead, it in volves an enduring and pervasive maladaptive
pattern of excessive perfectionism and rigid co ntrol. If an individual manifests symptoms
of both OCD and obsessive-compulsive persona lity disorder, both diagnoses can be given",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,287
"Comorbidity 
Individuals with OCD often have other psycho pathology. Many adults with the disorder
have a lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disord er (76%; e.g., panic disorder, social anxiety
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific  phobia) or a depressive or bipolar disorder
(63% for any depressive or bipolar disorder, with the most common being major depres-
sive disorder [41%]). Onset of OCD is usually later than for most co morbid anxiety disor-
ders (with the exception of separation anxiet y disorder) and PTSD bu t often precedes that
of depressive disorders. Comorbid obsessi ve-compulsive personality disorder is also
common in individuals with OCD (e.g., ranging from 23% to 32%). 
Up to 30% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder. A comorbid tic
disorder is most common in males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals
tend to differ from those without a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD
symptoms, comorbidity, course, and pattern of familial transmission. A triad of OCD, tic
disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivit y disorder can also be seen in children",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,287
"Disorders that occur more frequently in individuals with OCD than in those without
the disorder include several obsessive-compulsive and related disorders such as body
dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-pick-
ing) disorder. Finally, an association betw een OCD and some disorders characterized by
impulsivity, such as oppositional de fiant disorder, has been reported. 
OCD is also much more common in individuals with certain other disorders than
would be expected based on its prevalence in  the general population ; when one of those
other disorders is diagnosed, the individual should be assessed for OCD as well. For ex-
ample, in individuals with schizophrenia or  schizoaffective disorder, the prevalence of
OCD is approximately 12%. Rates of OCD are also  elevated in bipolar disorder; eating dis-
orders, such as anorexia nervosa and bu limia nervosa; and Tourette’s disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,287

"Diagnostic Features 
Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (formerly known as dysmorphophobia ) are pre-
occupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance, which
they believe look ugly, unattractive, abnormal , or deformed (Criterion A). The perceived
flaws are not observable or appear only slig ht to other individuals. Concerns range from
looking “unattractive” or “not  right” to looking “hideous” or “like a monster.” Preoccu-
pations can focus on one or many body are as, most commonly the skin (e.g., perceived
acne, scars, lines, wrinkles, paleness), hair (e.g., “thinning” hair or “e xcessive” body or fa-
cial hair), or nose (e.g., size or shape). Howe ver, any body area can be the focus of concern
(e.g., eyes, teeth, weight, stomach, breasts, le gs, face size or shape, lips, chin, eyebrows,
genitals). Some individuals are concerned abou t perceived asymmetry of body areas. The
preoccupations are intrusive,  unwanted, time-consuming (occurring, on average, 3–8
hours per day), and usually diff icult to resist or control. 
Excessive repetitive behaviors or mental ac ts (e.g., comparing) are performed in re-
sponse to the preoccupation (Criterion B). The individual feels driven to perform these be-
haviors, which are not pleasurable and may increase anxiety and dysphoria. They are
typically time-consuming and difficult to re sist or control. Common behaviors are com-
paring one’s appearance with that of other individuals; repeatedly checking perceived
defects in mirrors or other reflecting surf aces or examining them directly; excessively
grooming (e.g., combing, stylin g, shaving, plucking, or pull ing hair); camouflaging (e.g.,
repeatedly applying makeup or covering dislik ed areas with such things as a hat, clothing,
makeup, or hair); seeking reassurance about how the perceived flaws look; touching dis-
liked areas to check them; excessively exerci sing or weight lifting; and seeking cosmetic
procedures. Some individuals exce ssively tan (e.g., to darken “pale” skin or diminish per-
ceived acne), repeatedly change their clothe s (e.g., to camouflage perceived defects), or
compulsively shop (e.g., for beauty produc ts). Compulsive skin picking intended to
improve perceived skin defects is common and can cause skin damage, infections, or
ruptured blood vessels. The preoccupation must cause clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C);
usually both are present. Body dysmorphic diso rder must be differentiated from an eating
disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,288
"Muscle dysmorphia, a form of body dysmorphic disorder occurring almost exclusively
in males, consists of preoccup ation with the idea that one’s body is too small or insuffi-

ance",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,289
"Insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder  beliefs can range from good to absent/
delusional (i.e., delusional beliefs consisting of complete conviction that the individual’s
view of their appearance is accurate and un distorted). On average, insight is poor; one-
third or more of individuals currently have delusional body dysmorphic disorder beliefs",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,289
"Individuals with delusional body dysmorphic di sorder tend to have greater morbidity in
some areas (e.g., suicidality), but this appears accounted fo r by their tendency to have
more severe body dysmorphic disorder symptoms. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
Many individuals with body dysmorphic disord er have ideas or delusions of reference,
believing that other people take special notice  of them or mock them because of how they
look. Body dysmorphic disorder is associated with high levels of anxiety, social anxiety,
social avoidance, depressed mood, neuroticism, and perfectionism as well as low extro-
version and low self-esteem. Many individuals are ashamed of their appearance and their
excessive focus on how they look, and are relu ctant to reveal their concerns to others. A
majority of individuals receiv e cosmetic treatment to try to  improve their perceived de-
fects. Dermatological treatment and surgery ar e most common, but any type (e.g., dental,
electrolysis) may be received . Occasionally, individuals may perform surgery on them-
selves. Body dysmorphic disorder appears to respond poorly to  such treatments and
sometimes becomes worse. Some individuals ta ke legal action or are violent toward the
clinician because they are dissat isfied with the cosmetic outcome",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,289
"Body dysmorphic disorder has been associat ed with executive dysfunction and visual
processing abnormalities, with a bias for an alyzing and encoding details rather than ho-
listic or configural aspects of vi sual stimuli. Individuals with this disorder tend to have a
bias for negative and threatening interpretati ons of facial expressions and ambiguous sce-
narios. 
Prevalence 
The point prevalence among U.S.  adults is 2.4% (2.5% in females and 2.2% in males). Out-
side the United States (i.e., Germany), cu rrent prevalence is approximately 1.7%–1.8%,
with a gender distribution similar to that in  the United States. The current prevalence is
9%–15% among dermatology patients, 7%–8% am ong U.S. cosmetic surgery patients, 3%–
16% among international cosmetic surgery patients (most studies), 8% among adult orth-
odontia patients, and 10% among patients presenting for oral or maxillofacial surgery",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,289
"Development and Course 
The mean age at disorder onset is 16–17 years, the median age at onset is 15 years, and the
most common age at onset is 12–13 years. Two-thirds of individuals have disorder onset
before age 18. Subclinical body dysmorphic diso rder symptoms begin, on average, at age
12 or 13 years. Subclinical concerns usually ev olve gradually to the full disorder, although
some individuals experience abrupt onset of body dysmorphic disorder. The disorder
appears to usually be chronic, although improvement is likely when evidence-based
treatment is received. The disorder’s clinical features appear largely similar in children/
adolescents and adults. Body dysm orphic disorder occurs in th e elderly, but little is known
about the disorder in this age group. Individu als with disorder onset before age 18 years
are more likely to attempt suicide, have more comorbidity, and have  gradual (rather than
acute) disorder onset than those with adult-onset body dysmorphic disorder.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,289
"Body Dysmorphic Disorder 245
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Environmental. Body dysmorphic disorder has been as sociated with high rates of child-
hood neglect and abuse. 
Genetic and physiological. The prevalence of body dysmor phic disorder is elevated in
first-degree relatives of individuals with  obsessive-compulsi ve disorder (OCD)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,290
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
Body dysmorphic disorder has be en reported internationally. It appears that the disorder
may have more similarities th an differences across races and cultures but that cultural
values and preferences may influence symptom content to some degree. Taijin kyofusho,
included in the traditional Japanese diagnost ic system, has a subtype similar to body dys-
morphic disorder: shubo-kyofu  (“the phobia of a deformed body”). 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues 
Females and males appear to have more similariti es than differences in terms of most clin-
ical features— for example, di sliked body areas, types of repetitive behaviors, symptom
severity, suicidality, comorbidity, illness course, and receipt of cosmetic procedures for
body dysmorphic disorder. However, males ar e more likely to have genital preoccupa-
tions, and females are more likely to have a comorbid eating disord er. Muscle dysmorphia
occurs almost exclusively in males. 
Suicide Risk
Rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attemp ts are high in both adults and children/ado-
lescents with body dysmorphic disorder. Furthe rmore, risk for suicide appears high in ad-
olescents. A substantial proportion of individuals attribute suicidal ideation or suicide
attempts primarily to their appearance concerns. Individuals with body dysmorphic dis-
order have many risk factors for completed suic ide, such as high rates of suicidal ideation
and suicide attempts, demographic characterist ics associated with suicide, and high rates
of comorbid major depressive disorder. 
Functional Consequences of 
Body Dysmorphic Disorder
Nearly all individuals with body dysmorphic disorder experience impaired psychosocial
functioning because of their appearance concerns. Impairment can range from moderate
(e.g., avoidance of some social situations) to  extreme and incapacitating (e.g., being com-
pletely housebound). On average, psychosocial functioning and quality of life are mark-
edly poor. More severe body dysmorphic diso rder symptoms are associated with poorer
functioning and quality of life. Most individu als experience impairment in their job, aca-
demic, or role function ing (e.g., as a parent or caregive r), which is often severe (e.g., per-
forming poorly, missing school  or work, not working). About 20% of youths with body
dysmorphic disorder report dropping out of school primarily because of their body dys-
morphic disorder symptoms. Impair ment in social functioning (e.g., social activities, rela-
tionships, intimacy), includ ing avoidance, is common. In dividuals may be housebound
because of their body dysmor phic disorder symptoms, some times for years. A high pro-
portion of adults and adolescents have been psychiatrically hospitalized",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,290

morphic disorder should be diagnosed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,291

considered a symptom of the eating disorder  rather than body dysmorphic disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,291
"However, weight concerns may occur in body  dysmorphic disorder. Eating disorders and
body dysmorphic disorder can be comorbid, in which case both should be diagnosed. 
Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. The preoccupations and repetitive
behaviors of body dysmorphic  disorder differ from obsessions and compulsions in OCD
in that the former focus only on appearance. These disorders have other differences, such
as poorer insight in body dysmorphic disorder. When sk in picking is intended to improve
the appearance of perceived skin defects, bo dy dysmorphic disorder, rather than excoria-
tion (skin-picking) disorder, is diagnosed. Wh en hair removal (plucking, pulling, or other
types of removal) is intended to improve pe rceived defects in the appearance of facial
or body hair, body dysmorphic disorder is diagnosed rather than trichotillomania (hair-
pulling disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,291
"Illness anxiety disorder. Individuals with body dysmor phic disorder are not preoccu-
pied with having or acquiring a serious illness and do not have particularly elevated levels
of somatization. 
Major depressive disorder. The prominent preoccupation with appearance and exces-
sive repetitive behaviors in body dysmorphi c disorder differentiate it from major de-
pressive disorder. However, major depressi ve disorder and depressive symptoms are
common in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder, often appearing to be secondary
to the distress and impairment that body dysmorphic disorder causes. Body dysmorphic
disorder should be diagnosed in  depressed individuals if diag nostic criteria for body dys-
morphic disorder are met. 
Anxiety disorders. Social anxiety and avoidance are common in body dysmorphic dis-
order. However, unlike social anxiety disorder (social phobia), agoraphobia, and avoidant
personality disorder, body dy smorphic disorder includes prominent appearance-related
preoccupation, which may be delusional, and repetitive behaviors, and the social anxiety
and avoidance are due to concerns about perceived appearance defects and the belief or
fear that other people will consider these indivi duals ugly, ridicule them, or reject them be-
cause of their physical features. Unlike gene ralized anxiety disorder, anxiety and worry in
body dysmorphic disorder focus on  perceived appearance flaws. 
Psychotic disorders. Many individuals with body dy smorphic disorder have delu-
sional appearance beliefs (i.e., complete convic tion that their view of their perceived de-
fects is accurate), which is diagnosed as body dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/
delusional beliefs, not as delusional disorder. Appearance-related ideas or delusions of
reference are common in body dysmorphic di sorder; however, unlike schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder, body dysmorphic disorder involves  prominent appearance pre-
occupations and related repetitive behaviors,  and disorganized behavior and other psy-
chotic symptoms are absent (except for appearance beliefs , which may be delusional). 
Other disorders and symptoms. Body dysmorphic disorder should not be diagnosed if
the preoccupation is limited to discomfort with  or a desire to be rid of one’s primary and/
or secondary sex characteristics in an individu al with g ender dysphoria or if the preoccu-
pation focuses on the belief th at one emits a foul or offens ive body odor as in olfactory

as it would in body dysmorphic disorder. Koro,  a culturally related disorder that usually
occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, consists  of a fear that the penis (labia, nipples, or
breasts in females) is shrink ing or retracting and will disa ppear into the abdomen, often
accompanied by a belief that death will result . Koro differs from body dysmorphic disor-
der in several ways, including a focus on death rather than preoccupation with perceived
ugliness. Dysmorphic concern  (which is not a DSM-5 disorder) is a much broader construct

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of hoarding  disorder is persistent difficulties discarding or parting
with possessions, regardless of their actual value (Criterion A). The term persistent  indi-
cates a long-standing difficulty rather than more transient life circumstances that may lead
to excessive clutter, such as inheriting prop erty. The difficulty in discarding possessions
noted in Criterion A refers to  any form of discarding, including throwing away, selling,
giving away, or recycling. The main reasons given for these difficult ies are the perceived
utility or aesthetic value of the items or stro ng sentimental attachment to the possessions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,293
"Some individuals feel responsi ble for the fate of their possessions and often go to great
lengths to avoid being wasteful. Fears of lo sing important information are also common",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,293
"The most commonly saved item s are newspapers, magazines, old clothing, bags, books,
mail, and paperwork, but virtually any item can be saved. The nature of items is not lim-
ited to possessions that most other people would define as useles s or of limited value",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,293
"Many individuals collect and save large numbers of valuable things as well, which are of-
ten found in piles mixed with other less valuable items. 
Individuals with hoarding disorder purpos efully save possessions and experience dis-
tress when facing the prospect of discarding them (Criterion B). This criterion emphasizes
that the saving of possessions is intentional,  which discriminates hoarding disorder from
other forms of psychopathology that are ch aracterized by the pa ssive accumulation of
items or the absence of distress  when possessions are removed. 
Individuals accumulate large numbers of items that fill up and clutter active living ar-
eas to the extent that their intended use is no longer possible (Criterion C). For example,
the individual may not be able to cook in the kitchen, sleep in his or her bed, or sit in a
chair. If the space can be used, it  is only with great difficulty. Clutter  is defined as a large
group of usually unrelated or marginally rela ted objects piled together in a disorganized
fashion in spaces designed for ot her purposes (e.g., tabletops,  floor, hallway). Criterion C
emphasizes the “active” living areas of the ho me, rather than more peripheral areas, such
as garages, attics, or basements, that are so metimes cluttered in homes of individuals with-
out hoarding disorder. However, individuals with hoarding disorder often have posses-
sions that spill beyond the active living areas and can occupy and impair the use of other
spaces, such as vehicles, yards, the workplace,  and friends’ and relatives’ houses. In some
cases, living areas may be uncluttered because of the intervention of third parties (e.g.,
family members, cleaners, loca l authorities). Individuals who have been forced to clear
their homes still have a symptom picture that meets criteria fo r hoarding disorder because
the lack of clutter is due to a third-party intervention. Hoarding disorder contrasts with
normative collecting beha vior, which is organized and systematic, even if in some cases
the actual amount of possessions may be similar to the amount accumulated by an indi-
vidual with hoarding disord er. Normative collecting does not produce the clutter, dis-
tress, or impairment typi cal of hoarding disorder. 
Symptoms (i.e., difficulties discarding and/or  clutter) must cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational , or other important area s of functioning, in-
cluding maintaining a safe environment for self  and others (Criterion D). In some cases,",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,293

particularly when there is poor insight, the individual may not report distress, and the im-
pairment may be apparent only to those arou nd the individual. However, any attempts to
discard or clear the possessions by third pa rties result in high levels of distress. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Other common features of hoarding disorder include indecisiveness, perfectionism,
avoidance, procrastination, di fficulty planning and organizing tasks, and distractibility",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,294
"Some individuals with hoarding disorder live in unsanitary conditions that may be a log-
ical consequence of severely cluttered spaces and/or that are related to planning and or-
ganizing difficulties. Animal hoarding  can be defined as the accumulation of a large number
of animals and a failure to provide minimal st andards of nutrition, sanitation, and veter-
inary care and to act on the de teriorating condition of the an imals (including disease, star-
vation, or death) and the en vironment (e.g., severe overcrowding, extremely unsanitary
conditions). Animal hoarding may be a spec ial manifestation of ho arding disorder. Most
individuals who hoard animals also hoard inan imate objects. The mo st prominent differ-
ences between animal and object hoarding are the extent of unsanitary conditions and the
poorer insight in animal hoarding. 
Prevalence
Nationally representative prevalence studies of hoarding disorder are not available. Com-
munity surveys estimate the point prevalence of clinically significant hoarding in the
United States and Europe to be approximately 2%–6%. Hoarding disorder affects both
males and females, but some epidemiological studies have reported a significantly greater
prevalence among males. This contrasts with clinical samples, which are predominantly
female. Hoarding symptoms appear to be almost three times more prevalent in older
adults (ages 55–94 years) compared with younger adults (ages 34–44 years). 
Development and Course
Hoarding appears to begin early in life and spans well into the late stages. Hoarding symp-
toms may first emerge around ages 11–15 years, start interfering with the individual’s ev-
eryday functioning by the mid-20s, and cause clinically significant impairment by the
mid-30s. Participants in clinical research stud ies are usually in their 50s. Thus, the severity
of hoarding increases with each decade of lif e. Once symptoms begin, the course of hoard-
ing is often chronic, with few individuals reporting a waxing and waning course",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,294
"Pathological hoarding in children appears to be easily distin guished from develop-
mentally adaptive saving and collecting behaviors. Because children and adolescents
typically do not control their living environm ent and discarding behaviors, the possible
intervention of third parties (e.g., parents ke eping the spaces usable and thus reducing in-
terference) should be considered when making the diagnosis.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
While most of the research has been done in  Western, industrialized countries and urban
communities, the available data from non-Western and developing countries suggest that
hoarding is a universal phenomenon wi th consistent clinical features. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
The key features of hoarding disorder (i.e., difficulties discarding, excessive amount of
clutter) are generally comparable in males an d females, but females tend to display more
excessive acquisition, particularly excessive buying, than do males. 
Functional Consequences  of Hoarding Disorder
Clutter impairs basic activities, such as moving through the house, cooking, cleaning, per-
sonal hygiene, and even sleepin g. Appliances may be broken, and utilities such as water
and electricity may be disconnected, as access for repair work may be difficult. Quality of
life is often considerably impaired. In severe cases, hoarding can put in dividuals at risk for
fire, falling (especially elderly individuals), po or sanitation, and other health risks. Hoard-
ing disorder is associated with occupational impairment, poor physical health, and high
social service utilization. Family relationsh ips are frequently under great strain. Conflict
with neighbors and local author ities is common, and a substa ntial proportion of individ-
uals with severe hoarding disorder have been  involved in legal eviction proceedings, and
some have a history of eviction. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other medical conditions. Hoarding disorder is not di agnosed if the symptoms are
judged to be a direct conseque nce of another medical condition (Criterion E), such as trau-
matic brain injury, surgical resection for trea tment of a tumor or seizure control, cerebro-
vascular disease, infections of the central ne rvous system (e.g., herpes simplex encephalitis),
or neurogenetic conditions such as Prader -Willi syndrome. Damage to the anterior ven-
tromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices ha s been particularly associated with the ex-
cessive accumulation of objects. In these individuals, the hoarding behavior is not present
prior to the onset of the brain damage and a ppears shortly after the brain damage occurs",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,295
"Some of these individuals appear to have li ttle interest in the accumulated items and are
able to discard them easily or do not care if  others discard them, whereas others appear to
be very reluctant to discard anything.

tion of objects is judged to be a direct co nsequence of a neurodevel opmental disorder, such
as autism spectrum disorder or  intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,295

are judged to be a direct consequence of typical obsessions or compulsions, such as fears
of contamination, harm, or feelings of inco mpleteness in obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD). Feelings of incomplete ness (e.g., losing one’s identity , or having to document and

ing rituals)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,296
"In OCD, the behavior is gene rally unwanted and highly distressing, and the individual ex-
periences no pleasure or reward from it. Excessive acquisition is  usually not present; if exces-
sive acquisition is present, items are acquired because of a specific obsession (e.g., the need to
buy items that have been accidentally touched in order to avoid cont aminating other people),
not because of a genuine desire to possess the items. Individuals who hoard in the context of
OCD are also more likely to accumulate bizarre it ems, such as trash, feces, urine, nails, hair,
used diapers, or rotten food. Accumulation of su ch items is very unusual in hoarding disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,296
"When severe hoarding appears concurrently  with other typical symptoms of OCD but
is judged to be independent from these symptoms, both hoarding disorder and OCD may
be diagnosed. 
Neurocognitive disorders. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of
objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a degenerati ve disorder, such as neurocog-
nitive disorder associated wi th frontotemporal lobar degeneration or Alzheimer’s disease",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,296
"Typically, onset of the accumu lating behavior is gradual and follows onset of the neuro-
cognitive disorder. The accumulating behavior  may be accompanied by self-neglect and
severe domestic squalor, alongside other neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as disinhibi-
tion, gambling, rituals/stereotypies, tics, and self-injurious behaviors. 
Comorbidity
Approximately 75% of individuals with hoardi ng disorder have a comorbid mood or anx-
iety disorder. The most common comorbid conditions are major depressive disorder (up
to 50% of cases), social anxi ety disorder (social phobia), an d generalized anxiety disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,296
"Approximately 20% of individuals with hoardi ng disorder also have symptoms that meet
diagnostic criteria for OCD. These comorbidit ies may often be the main reason for consul-
tation, because individuals are unlikely to spontaneously report hoarding symptoms, and
these symptoms are often not asked ab out in routine clinical interviews",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,296

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of trichotillomania (hai r-pulling disorder) is the recurrent pulling out
of one’s own hair (Criterion A). Hair pullin g may occur from any region of the body in
which hair grows; the most co mmon sites are the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelids, while less
common sites are axillary, facial, pubic, and peri-rectal regions. Hair-pulling sites may
vary over time. Hair pulling may occur in brief episodes sc attered throughout the day or
during less frequent bu t more sustained periods that can continue for hours, and such hair",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,296

pulling may endure for months or years. Criterion A requires th at hair pulling lead to hair
loss, although individuals with this disorder may pull hair in a widely distributed pattern
(i.e., pulling single hairs from all over a site) such that hair loss may not be clearly visible",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,297
"Alternatively, individuals may attempt to conceal or camouflage hair loss (e.g., by using
makeup, scarves, or wigs). Individuals with  trichotillomania have made repeated at-
tempts to decrease or stop hair pulling (Crite rion B). Criterion C indicates that hair pulling
causes clinically significant distress or impa irment in social, occupational, or other impor-
tant areas of functioning. The term distress  includes negative affects that may be experi-
enced by individuals with hair  pulling, such as feeling a lo ss of control, embarrassment,
and shame. Significant impairment may occur in several different areas of functioning
(e.g., social, occupational, academic, and leisure), in part because of avoidance of work,
school, or other public situations. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Hair pulling may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals involving hair. Thus,
individuals may search for a particular kind of hair to pull (e.g., hairs with a specific tex-
ture or color), may try to pull out hair in a spec ific way (e.g., so that the root comes out in-
tact), or may visually examine or tactilely or  orally manipulate the hair after it has been
pulled (e.g., rolling the hair between the fingers,  pulling the strand between the teeth, bit-
ing the hair into pieces, or swallowing the hair). 
Hair pulling may also be preceded or acco mpanied by various emot ional states; it may
be triggered by feelings of anxiety or boredo m, may be preceded by an increasing sense of
tension (either immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the
urge to pull), or may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the hair is
pulled out. Hair-pulling behavior may involv e varying degrees of conscious awareness,
with some individuals displaying more focused attention on the hair pulling (with pre-
ceding tension and subsequent relief), and other individuals displaying more automatic
behavior (in which the hair pulling seems to occur without full awareness). Many individ-
uals report a mix of both behavioral styles. Some individuals experience an “itch-like” or
tingling sensation in the scalp that is alleviated by the act of pulling hair. Pain does not
usually accompany hair pulling",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,297
"Patterns of hair loss are highly variable. Ar eas of complete alopecia, as well as areas of
thinned hair density, are common. When the sc alp is involved, there may be a predilection
for pulling out hair in the crown or parietal regions. There may be a pattern of nearly com-
plete baldness except for a narrow perimeter around the outer margins of the scalp, par-
ticularly at the nape of the neck (“tonsure trichotillomania”). Eyebrows and eyelashes may
be completely absent. 
Hair pulling does not usually occur in the pr esence of other individuals, except imme-
diate family members. Some in dividuals have urges to pull hair from other individuals
and may sometimes try to find opportunities to  do so surreptitiously. Some individuals
may pull hairs from pets, dolls, and other fi brous materials (e.g., sw eaters or carpets)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,297
"Some individuals may deny their hair pulling to others. The majority of individuals with
trichotillomania also have one or more other body-focused repetitive behaviors, including
skin picking, nail biting, and lip chewing",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,297
"Prevalence
In the general population, the 12-month preval ence estimate for trichotillomania in adults
and adolescents is 1%–2%. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a ratio of
approximately 10:1. This estimate  likely reflects the true gender  ratio of the condition, al-
though it may also reflect differential treatment seeking based on ge nder or cultural at-
titudes regarding appearance (e.g., acceptan ce of normative hair loss among males)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,297

"Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder) 253
Development and Course
Hair pulling may be seen in infants, and this behavior typically resolves during early devel-
opment. Onset of hair pulling in trichotilloman ia most commonly coincides with, or follows
the onset of, puberty. Sites of hair pulling may vary over time. The usual course of trichotillo-
mania is chronic, with some waxing and waning if the disorder is untreated. Symptoms may
possibly worsen in females accompanying horm onal changes (e.g., menstruation, perimeno-
pause). For some individuals, the disorder may come and go for weeks, months, or years at a
time. A minority of individuals remit without su bsequent relapse within a few years of onset. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. There is evidence for a genetic vulnerability to trichotillo-
mania. The disorder is more common in in dividuals with obsessi ve-compulsive disorder
(OCD) and their first-degree relative s than in the general population. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
Trichotillomania appears to manifest similarly across cultures, although there is a paucity
of data from non-Western regions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,298
"Diagnostic Markers
Most individuals with trichotillomania admit to hair pulling; thus, dermatopathological
diagnosis is rarely required. Skin biopsy an d dermoscopy (or trichoscopy) of trichotillo-
mania are able to differentiat e the disorder from other causes of alopecia. In trichotil-
lomania, dermoscopy shows a range of charac teristic features, in cluding decreased hair
density, short vellus hair, and broken hairs with different shaft lengths. 
Functional Consequences of 
Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)
Trichotillomania is associated with distress as well as with social and occupational impair-
ment. There may be irreversible  damage to hair growth and hair quality. Infrequent med-
ical consequences of trichotillomania includ e digit purpura, muscul oskeletal injury (e.g.,
carpal tunnel syndrome; back, shoulder and neck pain), blepharitis, and dental damage
(e.g., worn or broken teeth due to hair biting). Swallowing of hair (trichophagia) may lead
to trichobezoars, with subs equent anemia, abdominal pain , hematemesis, nausea and
vomiting, bowel obstruction,  and even perforation. 
Differential Diagnosis
Normative hair re moval/manipulation. Trichotillomania should not be diagnosed when
hair removal is performed solely for cosmetic reasons (i.e., to improve one’s physical ap-
pearance). Many individuals twist and play with  their hair, but this behavior does not usu-
ally qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania . Some individuals may bite rather than pull
hair; again, this does not qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,298
"Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Individuals with OCD and sym-
metry concerns may pull out hairs as part of their symmetry rituals, and individuals with
body dysmorphic disorder may remove body ha ir that they perceive as ugly, asymmetri-
cal, or abnormal; in such cases a diagnosis of  trichotillomania is not given. The description
of body-focused repetitive behavior disorder  in other specified ob sessive-compulsive and
related disorder excludes individuals who meet  diagnostic criteria for trichotillomania.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,298

orders) rarely lead to hair pulling",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,299

loss is attributable to another medical conditio n (e.g., inflammation of the skin or other der-
matological conditions). Other causes of scarri ng alopecia (e.g., alop ecia areata, androgenic
alopecia, telogen effluvium) or nonscarring al opecia (e.g., chronic discoid lupus erythema-
tosus, lichen planopilaris, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, pseudopelade, folliculitis
decalvans, dissecting folliculitis, acne keloidalis nuchae) should be considered in individu-
als with hair loss who deny hair pulling. Skin biopsy or dermoscopy ca n be used to differ-
entiate individuals with tric hotillomania from those with  dermatological disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,299
"Substance-related disorders. Hair-pulling symptoms may be exacerbated by certain
substances—for example, stimulants—but it is less likely that substances are the primary
cause of persistent hair pulling. 
Comorbidity
Trichotillomania is often accompanied by ot her mental disorders, most commonly major
depressive disorder and excoriation (skin- picking) disorder. Repetitive body-focused
symptoms other than hair pulling or skin picking (e.g. nail biting) occur in the majority of

Functional Consequences of 
Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder 
Excoriation disorder is associated  with distress as well as with social and occupational im-
pairment. The majority of indi viduals with this condition spend at least 1 hour per day
picking, thinking about picking, and resist ing urges to pick. Many individuals report
avoiding social or entertainment events as well as going out in public. A majority of indi-
viduals with the disorder also report experien cing work interference from skin picking on
at least a daily or weekly basi s. A significant proportion of students with excoriation disor-
der report having missed school, having expe rienced difficulties managing responsibilities
at school, or having had diffi culties studying because of skin picking. Medical complica-
tions of skin picking include ti ssue damage, scarring, and infe ction and can be life-threaten-
ing. Rarely, synovitis of the wrists due to ch ronic picking has been reported. Skin picking
often results in significant tissue damage and sc arring. It frequently requires antibiotic treat-
ment for infection, and on o ccasion it may require surgery",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,301
"Differential Diagnosis
Psychotic disorder. Skin picking may occur in response to a delusion (i.e., parasitosis)
or tactile hallucination (i.e., fo rmication) in a psychotic disorder. In such cases, excoriation
disorder should not be diagnosed. 
Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Excessive washing compulsions
in response to contamination obsessions in in dividuals with OCD may lead to skin lesions,
and skin picking may occur in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder who pick their
skin solely because of appearance concerns; in  such cases, excoriatio n disorder should not
be diagnosed. The description of body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in other spec-
ified obsessive-compulsive and related diso rder excludes individuals whose symptoms
meet diagnostic criteria for excoriation disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,301

have early onset of skin picking, and their symptoms may meet criteria for stereotypic

attributable to the intention to harm oneself th at is characteristic of nonsuicidal self-injury",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,301
"Other medical conditions. Excoriation disorder is not di agnosed if the skin picking is
primarily attributable to another medical condition. For example, scabies is a dermatolog-
ical condition invariably associated with seve re itching and scratching. However, excori-
ation disorder may be precipitated or ex acerbated by an unde rlying dermatological

associated with comorbid excoriation diso rder. The differentiation between these two
clinical situations (acne with some scratching  and picking vs. acne with comorbid excori-
ation disorder) requires an assessment of the extent to which the individual’s skin picking
has become independent of the unde rlying dermatological condition. 
Substance/medication-induced disorders. Skin-picking symptoms may also be induced
by certain substances (e.g., cocaine), in whic h case excoriation disorder should not be di-

"Diagnostic Features
The essential features of substance/medicati on-induced obsessive-co mpulsive and related
disorder are prominent symptoms of an obsessive-compulsive  and related disorder (Criterion
A) that are judged to be attributable to the e ffects of a substance (e.g., drug of abuse, medica-
tion). The obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms must have developed during
or soon after substance intoxication or withdraw al or after exposure to a medication or toxin,
and the substance/medication must be capable of producing the symptoms (Criterion B). Sub-
stance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to a prescribed
treatment for a mental disorder or general medi cal condition must have its onset while the in-
dividual is receiving the medi cation. Once the treatment is discontinued, the obsessive-com-
pulsive and related disorder symp toms will usually improve or remit within days to several
weeks to 1 month (depending on the half-life of the substance/medica tion). The diagnosis of
substance/medication-induced obsessive-comp ulsive and related disorder should not be
given if onset of the obsessive-compulsive an d related disorder symp toms precedes the sub-
stance intoxicati on or medication use, or if the symp toms persist for a substantial period of
time, usually longer than 1 month,  from the time of severe into xication or with drawal. If the
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms persist for a substantial period of time,
other causes for the symptoms should be cons idered. The substance/medication-induced ob-
sessive-compulsive and related disorder diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis
of substance intoxication only when the sympto ms in Criterion A pred ominate in the clinical
picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Obsessions, compulsions, hair pulling, skin pick ing, or other body-focused repetitive be-
haviors can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances:
stimulants (including cocaine) and other (o r unknown) substances. Heavy metals and tox-
ins may also cause obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms. Laboratory as-
sessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may be usef ul to measure substance intoxication as part
of an assessment for obsessive-co mpulsive and related disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,304

"Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i.e., not induced by a substance). Sub-
stance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is judged to be
etiologically related to the substance/medi cation. Substance/medi cation-induced obses-

sive and related disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors with respect
to substances/medications. For drugs of abuse, there must be  evidence from the history,
physical examination, or laboratory findings  for use or intoxication. Substance/medica-
tion-induced obsessive-compulsiv e and related disorder arises only in association with in-
toxication, whereas a primary obsessive-compulsive and relate d disorder may precede the
onset of substance/medication use. The presence  of features that are atypical of a primary
obsessive-compulsive and relate d disorder, such as atypical age at onset of symptoms,
may suggest a substance-induced etiology. A primary obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder diagnosis is warranted if the sympto ms persist for a substa ntial period of time

nosed. The history often provides the basis for judgment. At times, a change in the
treatment for the other medical condition (e.g ., medication substitu tion or discontinua-
tion) may be needed to determine whether or not the medication is the causative agent (in
which case the symptoms may be better expl ained by substance/medication-induced ob-
sessive-compulsive and related diso rder). If the disturbance is attributable to both another
medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medicati on-induced obsessive-
compulsive and related disorder) may be given. When there is insufficie nt evidence to de-

the associated medical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical ex-
amination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B). Additionally, it must be judged that the
symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion C). The diagno-

and that this best explains the symptoms in the individual. Although there are no infallible
guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the obsessive-compulsive
and related symptoms and the medical conditio n is etiological, considerations that may
provide some guidance in making this diagno sis include the presence of a clear temporal
association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the
obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms; the presence of features that are atypical of
a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disord er (e.g., atypical age at onset or course);

"Diagnostic Features
Reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood is characterized by a pattern of
markedly disturbed and develo pmentally inappropriate attachment behaviors, in which a
child rarely or minimally turns preferentially to an attachment figure  for comfort, support,
protection, and nurturance. The essential featur e is absent or grossly underdeveloped at-
tachment between the child and putative caregiving adults. Children with reactive attach-
ment disorder are believed to have the capa city to form selective attachments. However,
because of limited opportunitie s during early development, they  fail to show the behavioral
manifestations of select ive attachments. That is, when di stressed, they show no consistent
effort to obtain comfort, support, nurturance, or protection from caregivers. Furthermore,
when distressed, children with this disorder do not respond more than minimally to com-
forting efforts of caregivers. Thus, the disord er is associated with th e absence of expected
comfort seeking and response to comforting behaviors. As such, children with reactive
attachment disorder show dimi nished or absent expression of positive emotions during
routine interactions with caregivers. In addi tion, their emotion regulation capacity is com-
promised, and they displa y episodes of negative emotions of fear, sadness, or irritability
that are not readily explained. A diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder should not be
made in children who are developmentally unab le to form se lective attachments. For this
reason, the child must have a develo pmental age of at least 9 months",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,311
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Because of the shared etiologica l association with social negl ect, reactive attachment dis-
order often co-occurs with developmental dela ys, especially in delays in cognition and
language. Other associated features include stereotypies and other signs of severe neglect
(e.g., malnutrition or signs of poor care). 
Prevalence
The prevalence of reactive atta chment disorder is unknown, bu t the disorder is seen rela-
tively rarely in clinical settings. The disorder has been found in young children exposed to
severe neglect before being placed in foster care or raised in  institutions. However, even in
populations of seve rely neglected children, the disord er is uncommon, occurring in less
than 10% of such children.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,311
"Reactive Attachment Disorder 267
Development and Course
Conditions of social neglect are often present in the first months of life in children diag-
nosed with reactive attachment disorder, even before the disorder is diagnosed. The clin-
ical features of the disorder manifest in a similar fashion between the ages of 9 months and
5 years. That is, signs of absent-to-minima l attachment behaviors and associated emotion-
ally aberrant behaviors are evident in childre n throughout this age range, although differ-
ing cognitive and motor abilities may affect how these behaviors ar e expressed. Without
remediation and recovery through normative care giving environments, it appears that signs
of the disorder may persist, at least for several years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,312

Environmental. Serious social neglect is a diagnost ic requirement for reactive attach-
ment disorder and is also the only known risk factor for the disorder. However, the ma-

depend on the quality of the caregiving  environment following serious neglect.

disorder have experienced a history of severe so cial neglect, although it is not always pos-
sible to obtain detailed historie s about the precise nature of th eir experiences, especially in
initial evaluations. Children with autistic spec trum disorder will only rarely have a history
of social neglect. The restricted interests an d repetitive behaviors ch aracteristic of autism

manifest as excessive adherenc e to rituals and routines; restricted, fixated interests; and

children with reactive attachment disorder do so only rarely or inconsistently, if at all",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,313
"Intellectual disability (intell ectual developmental disorder). Developmental delays of-
ten accompany reactive attachment disorder, but they should not be confused with the
disorder. Children with intellectual disability should exhibit social and emotional skills
comparable to their cognitive skills and do  not demonstrate the profound reduction in
positive affect and emotion regula tion difficulties evident in children with reactive attach-
ment disorder. In addition, developmentall y delayed children who have reached a cogni-
tive age of 7–9 months should demonstrate selective attachments regardless of their
chronological age. In contrast , children with reactive attach ment disorder show lack of
preferred attachment despite ha ving attained a developmental age of at least 9 months",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,313
"Depressive disorders. Depression in young children is also associated with reductions
in positive affect. There is limited evidence, ho wever, to suggest that  children with depres-
sive disorders have impairments in attachment . That is, young children who have been di-
agnosed with depressive disord ers still should seek and resp ond to comforting efforts by
caregivers",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,313
"Comorbidity
Conditions associated with neglect, includin g cognitive delays, language delays, and ste-
reotypies, often co-occur with reactive atta chment disorder. Medical conditions, such as
severe malnutrition, may accompany signs of the disorder. Depressive symptoms also
may co-occur with reactive attachment disorder. 
Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder

"B. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to impulsivity (as in attention-deficit/hyper-
activity disorder) but include socially disinhibited behavior. 
C. The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced by
at least one of the following:
1. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of having basic emotional
needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection met by caregiving adults",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,313
"2. Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit opportunities to form stable at-

all symptoms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at relatively high levels",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,314
"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of disinhibited social en gagement disorder is a pattern of behavior
that involves culturally inappropriate, overl y familiar behavior with relative strangers
(Criterion A). This overly familiar behavior violat es the social boundaries of the culture. A
diagnosis of disinhibited social engagement d isorder should not be made before children
are developmentally able to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must
have a developmental age of at least 9 months",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,314
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Because of the shared etiological association with social neglect, disinhibited social en-
gagement disorder may co-occu r with developmental delays, especially cognitive and lan-
guage delays, stereotypies, and other signs of severe neglect, such as malnutrition or poor
care. However, signs of the disorder often per sist even after these other signs of neglect are
no longer present. Therefore, it is not uncomm on for children with the disorder to present
with no current signs of neglect. Moreover , the condition can present in children who
show no signs of disordered attachment. Th us, disinhibited social engagement disorder
may be seen in children with a history of neglect who lack attach ments or whose attach-
ments to their caregivers range from disturbed to secure. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of disinhibited social attachment disorder is unknown. Nevertheless, the
disorder appears to be rare, occurring in a mi nority of children, even those who have been
severely neglected and subsequently placed in fo ster care or raised in institutions. In such
high-risk populations, the condition occurs in only about 20% of ch ildren. The condition is
seen rarely in other clinical settings. 
Development and Course
Conditions of social neglect are often present in the first months of life in children diag-
nosed with disinhibited social engagement di sorder, even before the disorder is diag-
nosed. However, there is no evidence that ne glect beginning after age 2 years is associated
with manifestations of the disorder. If ne glect occurs early and signs of the disorder
appear, clinical features of the disorder are moderately stable over time, particularly if
conditions of neglect pe rsist. Indiscriminate social behavior and lack of reticence with un-
familiar adults in toddlerhood are accompan ied by attention-seeking behaviors in pre-
schoolers. When the disorder persists into middle childhood, clinical features manifest as
verbal and physical overfamiliarity as well as  inauthentic expression of emotions. These
signs appear particularly apparent when the child interacts with adults. Peer relationships
are most affected in adolescence, with both  indiscriminate behavior and conflicts appar-
ent. The disorder has not been described in adults.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,314
"270 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders
Disinhibited social engagement disorder ha s been described from  the second year of
life through adolescence. There are some differences in manifestations of the disorder
from early childhood through adolescence. At  the youngest ages, across many cultures,
children show reticenc e when interacting with strangers. Young children with the disorder
fail to show reticence to approach, engage with, and even accompany adults. In preschool
children, verbal and social intrusiveness appear most prominent, often accompanied by
attention-seeking behavior. Ve rbal and physical overfamiliarity continue through middle
childhood, accomp anied by inauthentic expressions of  emotion. In adolescence, indis-
criminate behavior extends to peers. Relative to healthy adolescents, adolescents with the
disorder have more “superficial” peer relationships and more peer conflicts. Adult man-
ifestations of the disorder are unknown",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,315
"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Environmental. Serious social neglect is a diagnost ic requirement for disinhibited social
engagement disorder and is also the only know n risk factor for the disorder. However, the
majority of severely neglected children do not develop the disorder . Neurobiological vul-
nerability may differentiate neglected childr en who do and do not develop the disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,315
"However, no clear link with any specific neur obiological factors has been established. The
disorder has not been identified in children who experience social neglect only after age
2 years. Prognosis is only mode stly associated with quality of the caregiving environment
following serious neglect. In many cases, th e disorder persists, even in children whose
caregiving environment be comes markedly improved",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,315
"Course modifiers. Caregiving quality seems to moderate the course of disinhibited so-
cial engagement disorder. Nevertheless, ev en after placement in normative caregiving
environments, some children show persistent signs of the disorder, at least through ado-
lescence. 
Functional Consequences of 
Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder
Disinhibited social engagement disorder significantly impairs young children’s abilities to
relate interpersonally to adults and peers",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,315
"Differential Diagnosis
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Because of social impulsivity that sometimes
accompanies attention-deficit/hyperactivity di sorder (ADHD), it is necessary to differ-
entiate the two disorders. Children with disi nhibited social engagement disorder may be
distinguished from those with ADHD because th e former do not show difficulties with at-
tention or hyperactivity. 
Comorbidity
Limited research has examined the issue of disorders comorbid with disinhibited social
engagement disorder. Conditions associated with neglect, including cognitive delays,
language delays, and stereotypies, may co-occu r with disinhibited social engagement dis-
order. In addition, children may be diagnosed with ADHD and disinhibited social engage-
ment disorder concurrently. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,315

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the development of char-
acteristic symptoms following exposure to one or more tr aumatic events. Emotional re-
actions to the traumatic event (e.g., fear, he lplessness, horror) are no longer a part of
Criterion A. The clinical presentation of PTSD  varies. In some individuals, fear-based re-
experiencing, emotional, and behavioral sy mptoms may predominate. In others, anhe-
donic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may be most distressing. In some
other individuals, arousal an d reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, while in
others, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some individuals exhibit combina-
tions of these symptom patterns. 
The directly experienced traumatic events in  Criterion A include, but are not limited
to, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian,  threatened or actual physical assault (e.g.,
physical attack, robbery, mugging, childhood phy sical abuse), threatened or actual sexual
violence (e.g., forced sexual penetration, al cohol/drug-facilitated se xual penetration, abu-
sive sexual contact, noncontact sexual abuse,  sexual trafficking), being kidnapped, being
taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarc eration as a prisoner of war, natural or hu-
man-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents. For children, sexually violent
events may include developmentally inapprop riate sexual experiences without physical
violence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not neces-
sarily considered a traumatic event. Medical in cidents that qualify as traumatic events in-
volve sudden, catastrophic ev ents (e.g., waking during su rgery, anaphylactic shock)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,319
"Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened  or serious injury,
unnatural death, physical or sexual abuse of another person due to violent assault, domes-
tic violence, accident, war or di saster, or a medical catastrophe  in one’s child (e.g., a life-
threatening hemorrhage). Indirect exposure th rough learning about an event is limited to
experiences affecting close relatives or friend s and experiences that are violent or acciden-
tal (e.g., death due to natural causes does no t qualify). Such events include violent per-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,319

sonal assault, suicide, serious accident, and se rious injury. The disorder may be especially
severe or long-lasting when the stressor is interpersonal and intentiona l (e.g., torture, sex-
ual violence). 
The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual
has recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollect ions of the event (Criterion B1). Intrusive
recollections in PTSD are distinguished from depressive rumination in that they apply
only to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories. The emphasis is on recurrent
memories of the event that us ually include sensory, emotiona l, or physiological behavioral
components. A common reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams that replay the
event itself or that are representative or th ematically related to th e major threats involved
in the traumatic event (Criterion B2). The in dividual may experience dissociative states
that last from a few seconds to several hours or even days , during which components of
the event are relived and the individual behaves as if the event were occurring at that mo-
ment (Criterion B3). Such events occur on a continuum from brief vi sual or other sensory
intrusions about part of the traumatic event wi thout loss of reality or ientation, to complete
loss of awareness of present surroundings. These episodes, often re ferred to as “flash-
backs,” are typically brief but can be associ ated with prolonged distress and heightened
arousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play
or in dissociative states. Intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological re-
activity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the individual is exposed to triggering events that
resemble or symbolize an aspect of the trauma tic event (e.g., windy days after a hurricane;
seeing someone who resembles one’s perpetrator). The trigge ring cue could be a physical
sensation (e.g., dizziness for survivors of head trauma; rapid heartbeat for a previously
traumatized child), particularly for indivi duals with highly somatic presentations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,320
"Stimuli associated with the trauma are pers istently (e.g., always or almost always)
avoided. The individual commonly makes delib erate efforts to avoid thoughts, memories,
feelings, or talking about the traumatic event (e .g., utilizing distraction techniques to avoid
internal reminders) (Criterion C1) and to av oid activities, objects, situations, or people
who arouse recollections of it (Criterion C2)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,320
"Negative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the event begin or worsen
after exposure to the event. These negative al terations can take various forms, including an
inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event; such amnesia is typically
due to dissociative amnesia and is not due to he ad injury, alcohol, or drugs (Criterion D1)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,320
"Another form is persistent (i.e., always or almost always) and exaggerated negative ex-
pectations regarding important aspects of life a pplied to oneself, others, or the future (e.g.,
“I have always had bad judgment”; “People in  authority can’t be trusted”) that may man-
ifest as a negative change in perceived identi ty since the trauma (e.g., “I can’t trust anyone
ever again”; Criterion D2). Individuals with PTSD may have persistent erroneous cogni-
tions about the causes of the traumatic event that lead them to blame themselves or others
(e.g., “It’s all my fault that my uncle abused me”) (Criterion D3). A persistent negative
mood state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame) either began or worsened after exposure
to the event (Criterion D4). The individual may experience markedly diminished interest
or participation in previously enjoyed activities (C riterion D5), feeling detached or es-
tranged from other people (Criterion D6), or a persiste nt inability to feel positive emotions

destructive behavior such as dangerous drivin g, excessive alcohol or drug use, or self-
injurious or suicidal behavior (Criterion E2).   PTSD is often characterized by a heightened

suffering a heart attack) (Criterion E3). Individuals with PTSD may be very reactive to un-
expected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response, or jumpiness, to loud noises or
unexpected movements (e.g., jumping markedly in response to a telephone ringing) (Cri-
terion E4). Concentration difficulties, includ ing difficulty remembering daily events (e.g.,
forgetting one’s telephone numb er) or attending to focused t asks (e.g., following a conver-
sation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported (Criterion E5). Problems
with sleep onset and maintenance are commo n and may be associated with nightmares
and safety concerns or with generalized elevated  arousal that interferes with adequate sleep
(Criterion E6). Some in dividuals also experien ce persistent dissociative symptoms of de-
tachment from their bodies (depersonalization) or the world around them (derealization);
this is reflected in the “with di ssociative symptoms” specifier",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,321
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Developmental regression, such as loss of la nguage in young children, may occur. Audi-
tory pseudo-hallucinations, such as having  the sensory experience of hearing one’s
thoughts spoken in one or more different voic es, as well as paranoid ideation, can be pres-
ent. Following prolonged, repeated, and seve re traumatic events (e.g., childhood abuse,
torture), the individual may additionally experi ence difficulties in regulating emotions or
maintaining stable interpersonal relationship s, or dissociative symptoms. When the trau-
matic event produces violent death, symptoms of both problematic bereavement and PTSD
may be present. 
Prevalence
In the United States, projected lifetime risk for PTSD using DS M-IV criteria at age 75 years
is 8.7%. Twelve-month prevalence among U.S. adults is about 3.5%. Lower estimates are
seen in Europe and most Asian, African, an d Latin American countries, clustering around
0.5%–1.0%. Although different groups have di fferent levels of exposure to traumatic
events, the conditional probability of developi ng PTSD following a similar level of expo-
sure may also vary across cultural groups. Rates of PTSD are higher among veterans and
others whose vocation increases the risk of tr aumatic exposure (e.g., police, firefighters,
emergency medical personnel). Highest rates (r anging from one-third to more than one-
half of those exposed) are found among surv ivors of rape, military combat and captivity,
and ethnically or politically motivated intern ment and genocide. The prevalence of PTSD
may vary across development; children and adolescents, including preschool children,
generally have displayed lower prevalence following exposure to serious traumatic
events; however, this may be because previo us criteria were insufficiently developmen-
tally informed. The prevalence of full-thresh old PTSD also appears to be lower among
older adults compared with the general popu lation; there is eviden ce that subthreshold
presentations are more common th an full PTSD in later life and that these symptoms are
associated with substantial clinical impairme nt. Compared with U.S. non-Latino whites,
higher rates of PTSD have been reported among U.S. Latinos, African Americans, and
American Indians, and lower rates have been reported among Asian Americans, after ad-
justment for traumatic exposu re and demographic variables",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,321
"Development and Course
PTSD can occur at any age, beginning after th e first year of life. Symptoms usually begin
within the first 3 months after the trauma, although there may be a delay of months, or
even years, before criteria for the diagnosis  are met. There is abundant evidence for what
DSM-IV called “delayed onset” but is now call ed “delayed expression,” with the recogni-
tion that some symptoms typically appear immediately and that the delay is in meeting
full criteria.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,321
"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 277
Frequently, an individual’s reaction to a tr auma initially meets cr iteria for acute stress
disorder in the immediate aftermath of the trauma. The symptoms of PTSD and the rela-
tive predominance of different symptoms may vary over time. Duration of the symptoms
also varies, with complete recovery within 3 months occurring in approximately one-half
of adults, while some individuals remain symptomatic for longer  than 12 months and
sometimes for more than 50 years. Symptom recurrence and intens ification may occur in
response to reminders of the original trauma, ongoing life stressors, or newly experienced
traumatic events. For older individuals, dec lining health, worsening cognitive function-
ing, and social isolation ma y exacerbate PTSD symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,322
"The clinical expression of reexperiencing can vary across development. Young children
may report new onset of frightening dreams wi thout content specific to the traumatic event",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,322
"Before age 6 years (see criteria for preschool su btype), young children are more likely to ex-
press reexperiencing symptoms through play th at refers directly or symbolically to the
trauma. They may not manifest fe arful reactions at the time of the exposure or during reex-
periencing. Parents may report a wide range of  emotional or behavioral changes in young
children. Children may focus on imagined interventions in their play or storytelling. In ad-
dition to avoidance, children  may become preoccupied with reminders. Because of young
children’s limitations in expressing thoughts or labeling emotions, negative alterations in
mood or cognition tend to involve primarily mood changes. Children may experience co-
occurring traumas (e.g., physical abuse, witnes sing domestic violence) and in chronic cir-
cumstances may not be able to identify onset of symptomatology. Avoidant behavior may
be associated with restricted play or explor atory behavior in youn g children; reduced par-
ticipation in new activities in school-age children; or reluctance to pursue developmental op-
portunities in adolescents (e.g ., dating, driving). Older children and adolescents may judge
themselves as cowardly. Adolescents may harb or beliefs of being changed in ways that
make them socially undesirable and estrange them from peers (e.g., “Now I’ll never fit in”)
and lose aspirations for the future. Irritable or aggressive behavior in children and adoles-
cents can interfere with peer relationships and sch ool behavior. Reckless behavior may lead
to accidental injury to self or  others, thrill-seeking, or high-risk behaviors. Individuals who
continue to experience PTSD into older ad ulthood may express fe wer symptoms of hy-
perarousal, avoidance, and ne gative cognitions and mood compared with younger adults
with PTSD, although adults ex posed to traumatic events duri ng later life may display more
avoidance, hyperarousal, sleep problems, and crying spells than do younger adults exposed
to the same traumatic events. In older individu als, the disorder is associated with negative
health perceptions, primary care ut ilization, and suicidal ideation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,322
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Risk (and protective) factors are generally divided into pretraumatic , peritraumatic, and
posttraumatic factors. 
Pretraumatic factors
Temperamental. These include childhood emotional prob lems by age 6 years (e.g., prior
traumatic exposure, externalizing or anxiety problems) and prior me ntal disorders (e.g.,
panic disorder, depressive disorder, PTSD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD])",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,322
"Environmental. These include lower socioeconomic st atus; lower education; exposure to
prior trauma (especially during  childhood); childhood adversity (e.g., economic depriva-
tion, family dysfunction, parental separation or  death); cultural charac teristics (e.g., fatal-
istic or self-blaming coping strategies); lower intelligence; minority racial/ethnic status;
and a family psychiatric history. Social suppo rt prior to event exposure is protective",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,322
"Genetic and physiological. These include female gender and younger age at the time of
trauma exposure (for adults). Certain genotypes may either be  protective or increase risk
of PTSD after exposure  to traumatic events. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,322
"278 Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders
Peritraumatic factors
Environmental. These include severity (dose) of th e trauma (the greater the magnitude
of trauma, the greater the likelihood of PTSD), perceived life threat, personal injury, in-
terpersonal violence (particularly trauma pe rpetrated by a caregiver or involving a wit-
nessed threat to a caregiver in children), and,  for military personnel, being a perpetrator,
witnessing atrocities, or killing the enemy. Fina lly, dissociation that occurs during the trauma
and persists afterward is a risk factor",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,323
"Posttraumatic factors
Temperamental. These include negative appraisals, inappropriate coping strategies,
and development of ac ute stress disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,323
"Environmental. These include subsequent exposure to repeated upsetting reminders, subse-
quent adverse life events, and financial or other trauma-related losses. Social support (includ-
ing family stability, for children) is a protecti ve factor that moderate s outcome after trauma. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
The risk of onset and severity of PTSD may differ  across cultural groups as a result of vari-
ation in the type of traumatic exposure (e.g., genocide), the impact on disorder severity of
the meaning attributed to the tr aumatic event (e.g., inability to  perform funerary rites after
a mass killing), the ongoing so ciocultural context (e.g., re siding among unpunished per-
petrators in postconflict settings), and other cultural factors (e.g., acculturative stress in
immigrants). The relative risk for PTSD of particular exposures (e .g., religious persecu-
tion) may vary across cultural groups. The clin ical expression of the symptoms or symp-
tom clusters of PTSD may vary culturally, particularly with respect to avoidance and
numbing symptoms, distressing dreams, and somatic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, short-
ness of breath, heat sensations)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,323
"Cultural syndromes and idioms of distress influence the expression of PTSD and the
range of comorbid disorders in  different cultures by providi ng behavioral and cognitive
templates that link traumatic exposures to specific symptoms. For example, panic attack
symptoms may be salient in PTSD among Cambodians and Latin Americans because of
the association of traumatic exposure with panic-like khyâl attacks and ataque de nervios",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,323
"Comprehensive evaluation of local expression s of PTSD should include assessment of cul-
tural concepts of distress (see the chapter “Cultural Formulation” in Section III)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,323
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
PTSD is more prevalent among females than among males across the lifespan. Females in
the general population experience PTSD for a longer duration than do males. At least some
of the increased risk for PTSD in females appe ars to be attributable  to a greater likelihood
of exposure to traumatic events, such as rape, and other forms of interpersonal violence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,323
"Within populations exposed specifically to such  stressors, gender differences in risk for
PTSD are attenuated or nonsignificant",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,323
"Suicide Risk
Traumatic events such as childhood abuse increa se a person’s suicide risk. PTSD is associated
with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, an d presence of the disorder may indicate which
individuals with ideation even tually make a suicide plan or actually attempt suicide",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,323
"Functional Consequences of 
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
PTSD is associated with high levels of social , occupational, and physical disability, as well
as considerable economic costs and high leve ls of medical utilization. Impaired function-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,323

poor social and family relationships, absent eeism from work, lower income, and lower ed-
ucational and occupational success",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,324
"Differential Diagnosis
Adjustment disorders. In adjustment disorders, the st ressor can be of any severity or
type rather than that required by PTSD Crit erion A. The diagnosis of an adjustment dis-
order is used when the response to a stressor that meets PTSD Criterion A does not meet
all other PTSD criteria (or criteria for another mental disorder). An adjustment disorder is
also diagnosed when the symptom pattern of PTSD occurs in response to a stressor that
does not meet PTSD Criterion A (e .g., spouse leaving, being fired)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,324
"Other posttraumatic diso rders and conditions. Not all psychopathology that occurs in
individuals exposed to an extreme stressor sh ould necessarily be attributed to PTSD. The
diagnosis requires that trauma exposure prec ede the onset or exacer bation of pertinent
symptoms. Moreover, if the symptom response pattern to the extreme stressor meets cri-
teria for another mental disorder, these diagnoses should be given instead of, or in addi-
tion to, PTSD. Other diagnoses and conditions are excluded if they are better explained by
PTSD (e.g., symptoms of panic disorder that  occur only after exposure to traumatic re-
minders). If severe, symptom response patter ns to the extreme stressor may warrant a sep-
arate diagnosis (e.g., dissociative amnesia). 
Acute stress disorder. Acute stress disorder is distin guished from PTSD because the
symptom pattern in acute stress disorder is restricted to a duration of 3 days to 1 month
following exposure to  the traumatic event",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,324
"Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In OCD, there are recurrent
intrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition  of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive
thoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually pres-
ent, and other symptoms of PTSD or acute stre ss disorder are typically absent. Neither the
arousal and dissociative symptoms of panic di sorder nor the avoidance, irritability, and
anxiety of generalized anxiety disorder are associated with a specific traumatic event. The
symptoms of separation anxiety disorder are clearly related to separation from home or
family, rather than to a traumatic event",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,324
"Major depressive disorder. Major depression may or may not be preceded by a trau-
matic event and should be diagnosed if othe r PTSD symptoms are absent. Specifically, ma-
jor depressive disorder does not include any PTSD Criterion B or C symptoms. Nor does it
include a number of symptoms from PTSD Criterion D or E",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,324
"Personality disorders. Interpersonal difficulties that had their onset, or were greatly ex-
acerbated, after exposure to a traumatic event may be an indica tion of PTSD, rather than a
personality disorder, in which such difficulties would be expected independently of any
traumatic exposure",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,324
"Dissociative disorders. Dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, and de-
personalization-derealization disorder may or may not be preceded by exposure to a trau-
matic event or may or may not have co-occurri ng PTSD symptoms. When full PTSD criteria
are also met, however, the PTSD “with dissoci ative symptoms” subtype should be considered",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,324

orders due to another medical condition. 
Traumatic brain injury. When a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g.,
traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/d eceleration trauma), symptoms of PTSD may
appear. An event causing head trauma may also  constitute a psychological traumatic event,
and tramautic brain injury (TBI)–related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive
and may occur concurrently. Sy mptoms previously termed postconcussive  (e.g., headaches,
dizziness, sensitivity to light or  sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain-
injured and non-brain-injured populations, in cluding individuals with PTSD. Because symp-
toms of PTSD and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis
between PTSD and neurocognitive disorder sy mptoms attributable to TBI may be possible
based on the presence of symptoms that are di stinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexpe-
riencing and avoidance are characteristic of PTSD  and not the effects of TBI, persistent disori-
entation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to PTSD",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,325
"Comorbidity
Individuals with PTSD are 80% more likely than those without PTSD to have symptoms
that meet diagnostic criteria for at least one other mental disorder (e.g., depressive, bipo-
lar, anxiety, or substance use disorders). Comorbid substance use disorder and conduct
disorder are more common among males than  among females. Among U.S. military per-
sonnel and combat veterans who have been de ployed to recent wars  in Afghanistan and
Iraq, co-occurrence of PTSD and mild TBI is  48%. Although most  young children with
PTSD also have at least one other diagnosis, the patterns of comorbidity are different than
in adults, with oppositional defiant disorder  and separation anxiety disorder predominat-
ing. Finally, there is considerable comorb idity between PTSD and major neurocognitive
disorder and some overlapping sy mptoms between these disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,325

dominate, although these individuals typically  will also display strong emotional or phys-
iological reactivity in response to trauma re minders. In other individuals, there can be a
strong anger response in which reactivity is characterized by irritable or possibly aggres-
sive responses. The full symptom picture must be  present for at least 3 days after the trau-

car triggering memories of gunshots). Thes e intrusive memories often include sensory
(e.g., sensing the intense heat that was percei ved in a house fire), emotional (e.g., experi-
encing the fear of believing that one was about  to be stabbed), or physiological (e.g., expe-

ways other than combat.)
Dissociative states may last from a few seco nds to several hours, or even days, during

encing the event at that moment. While disso ciative responses are common during a trau-
matic event, only dissociative responses that  persist beyond 3 days after trauma exposure

of events related to trauma may appear in  play and may include dissociative moments
(e.g., a child who survives a motor vehicle accident may repe atedly crash toy cars during
play in a focused and distressing manner).  These episodes, often referred to as flashbacks,

behavior with little provocation. Acute stress disorder is often characterized by a height-
ened sensitivity to potential th reats, including those that are related to the traumatic ex-
perience (e.g., a motor vehicle accident vict im may be especially sensitive to the threat
potentially caused by any cars or trucks) or those not related to the traumatic event (e.g.,

heightened startle response or jumpiness to loud noises or unexpe cted movements (e.g.,
the individual may jump markedly in the response to a telephone ringing). 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with acute stress disorder common ly engage in catastrophic or extremely neg-
ative thoughts about thei r role in the traumatic event, th eir response to the traumatic ex-
perience, or the likelihood of future harm. For example, an individual with acute stress
disorder may feel excessively guilty about not having prevented the traumatic event or
about not adapting to the experience more su ccessfully. Individuals with acute stress dis-
order may also interpret their symptoms in  a catastrophic manner, such that flashback
memories or emotional numbing may be interpreted as a sign of diminished mental ca-
pacity. It is common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience panic attacks
in the initial month after trauma exposure th at may be triggered by trauma reminders or
may apparently occur spontaneously. Addition ally, individuals with acute stress disorder
may display chaotic or impulsive behavior. For example, individuals may drive reck-
lessly, make irrational decisions, or gamble  excessively. In children, there may be sig-
nificant separation anxiety, possibly mani fested by excessive needs for attention from",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,328

caregivers. In the case of be reavement following a death that occurred in traumatic cir-
cumstances, the symptoms of acute stress di sorder can involve acute grief reactions. In
such cases, reexperiencing, dissociative, an d arousal symptoms ma y involve reactions to
the loss, such as intrusive memories of the ci rcumstances of the individual’s death, disbe-
lief that the individual has died, and ange r about the death. Po stconcussive symptoms
(e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits),
which occur frequently following  mild traumatic brain injury, are also frequently seen in
individuals with acute stress disorder. Po stconcussive symptoms are equally common in
brain-injured and non–brain-injured populations, and the frequent occurrence of postcon-
cussive symptoms could be attributable  to acute stress disorder symptoms. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of acute stress disorder in recently trauma-exposed populations (i.e.,
within 1 month of trauma exposure) varies ac cording to the nature of the event and the
context in which it is assessed. In both U.S. and non-U.S. population s, acute stress disorder
tends to be identified in less than 20% of ca ses following traumatic events that do not in-
volve interpersonal assault; 13%–21% of motor vehicle accidents, 14% of mild traumatic
brain injury, 19% of assault, 10% of severe burns, and 6%–12% of industrial accidents",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,329
"Higher rates (i.e., 20%–50%) are reported following interpersonal traumatic events, in-
cluding assault, rape, and witnessing a mass shooting. 
Development and Course
Acute stress disorder cannot be diagnosed un til 3 days after a traumatic event. Although
acute stress disorder may prog ress to posttraumatic stress di sorder (PTSD) after 1 month,
it may also be a transient stress response th at remits within 1 month of trauma exposure
and does not result in PTSD. Approximately half of individuals who eventually develop
PTSD initially present with acute stress diso rder. Symptom worsenin g during the initial
month can occur, often as a result of ongoin g life stressors or further traumatic events. 
The forms of reexperiencing can vary acro ss development. Unlike adults or adoles-
cents, young children may report frightening dreams without content that clearly reflects
aspects of the trauma (e.g., waki ng in fright in the aftermath of the trauma but being unable
to relate the content of the dream to the traumatic event). Ch ildren age 6 years and younger
are more likely than older children to expres s reexperiencing symptoms through play that
refers directly or symbolically to the trauma. For example, a very young child who sur-
vived a fire may draw pictures of flames. Yo ung children also do not necessarily manifest
fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or even during reexperiencing. Parents typi-
cally report a range of emotional expressions,  such as anger, shame, or withdrawal, and
even excessively bright positiv e affect, in young children who are traumatized. Although
children may avoid reminders of the trauma, they sometimes become preoccupied with
reminders (e.g., a young child bitten by a dog may talk about dogs constantly yet avoid go-
ing outside because of fear of coming into contact with a dog). 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. Risk factors include prior mental diso rder, high levels of negative af-
fectivity (neuroticism), greater perceived seve rity of the traumatic event, and an avoidant
coping style. Catastrophic appraisals of th e traumatic experience, often characterized by
exaggerated appraisals of future harm, guilt, or hopelessness, are strongly predictive of
acute stress disorder. 
Environmental. First and foremost, an individual must  be exposed to a traumatic event to
be at risk for acute stress disorder. Risk fact ors for the disorder include a history of prior
trauma.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,329
"Acute Stress Disorder 285
Genetic and physiological. Females are at greater risk for developing acute stress dis-
order",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,330
"Elevated reactivity, as reflected by acousti c startle response, prior to trauma exposure
increases the risk for developing acute stress disorder. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
The profile of symptoms of acute stress disorder may vary cross-culturally, particularly
with respect to dissociative symptoms, ni ghtmares, avoidance, and somatic symptoms
(e.g., dizziness, shortness of breath, heat se nsations). Cultural sy ndromes and idioms of
distress shape the local symptom profiles of acute stress disorder. Some cultural groups
may display variants of dissociative response s, such as possession or trancelike behaviors
in the initial month after trauma exposure. Pa nic symptoms may be salient in acute stress
disorder among Cambodians because of the as sociation of traumatic exposure with panic-
like khyâl  attacks, and ataque de nervios  among Latin Americans may also follow a traumatic
exposure. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Acute stress disorder is more prevalent am ong females than among males. Sex-linked neu-
robiological differences in stre ss response may contribute to females’ increased risk for
acute stress disorder. The increased risk for the disorder in females may be attributable in
part to a greater likelihood of exposure to th e types of traumatic events with a high con-
ditional risk for acute stress  disorder, such as rape and other interpersonal violence. 
Functional Consequences of Acute Stress Disorder
Impaired functioning in social, interpersona l, or occupational domains has been shown
across survivors of accidents, assault, and rape  who develop acute stress disorder. The ex-
treme levels of anxiety that may be associa ted with acute stress disorder may interfere
with sleep, energy levels, and capacity to a ttend to tasks. Avoidance in acute stress dis-
order can result in generalized withdrawal from many situations that are perceived as
potentially threatening, which can lead to nonattendance of medical appointments, avoid-
ance of driving to important appointments, and absenteeism from work. 
Differential Diagnosis
Adjustment disorders. In acute stress disorder, the stress or can be of any severity rather
than of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress di sorder. The diagnosis of
an adjustment disorder is used when the response to a Criterion A event does not meet the cri-
teria for acute stress disorder (o r another specific mental diso rder) and when the symptom pat-
tern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet Criterion A for
exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual  violence (e.g., spouse leaving,
being fired). For example, severe  stress reactions to life-threate ning illnesses that may include
some acute stress disorder symptoms may be more appropriately desc ribed as an adjustment
disorder. Some forms of acute stress response do not include acute stress disorder symptoms
and may be characterized by anger, depression, or guilt. These responses are more appro-
priately described as primarily an adjustment disorder. Depressive or anger responses in an
adjustment disorder may involve rumination ab out the traumatic event, as opposed to invol-
untary and intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,330
Panic disorder. Spontaneous panic attacks are very common in acute stress disorder,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,330

"Traumatic brain injury. When a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event
(e.g., traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), symptoms of
acute stress disorder may appear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a

symptoms are not mutually exclusive and ma y occur concurrently. Symptoms previously
termed postconcussive  (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitiv ity to light or sound, irritability,
concentration deficits) can occur in brain-injured and non–brain injured populations, in-
cluding individuals with acute stress disorder . Because symptoms of acute stress disorder
and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis between
acute stress disorder and neurocognitive di sorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be
possible based on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presenta-
tion. Whereas reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of acut e stress disorder and
not the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation  and confusion are more specific to TBI (neu-
rocognitive effects) than to acute stress disord er. Furthermore, differential is aided by the

"Diagnostic Features
The presence of emotional or behavioral sympto ms in response to an identifiable stressor
is the essential feature of adju stment disorders (Criterion A) . The stressor may be a single
event (e.g., a termination of a romantic relati onship), or there may be multiple stressors
(e.g., marked business difficulties and marita l problems). Stressors may be recurrent (e.g.,
associated with seasonal busi ness crises, unfulfilling sexual relationships) or continuous
(e.g., a persistent painful illness with increasi ng disability, living in a crime-ridden neigh-
borhood). Stressors may affect a single individual, an entire family, or a larger group or
community (e.g., a natural disaster). Some st ressors may accompany specific developmen-
tal events (e.g., going to school, leaving a parental home, reentering a parental home, get-
ting married, becoming a parent, failing to attain occupational goals, retirement). 
Adjustment disorders may be diagnosed follo wing the death of a loved one when the
intensity, quality, or persis tence of grief reactions exceeds what normally might be ex-
pected, when cultural, religious, or age-appr opriate norms are taken into account. A more
specific set of bereavement-relate d symptoms has been designated persistent complex be-
reavement disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,332

"Prevalence
Adjustment disorders ar e common, although prevalence may vary widely as a function of
the population studied and the assessment me thods used. The percentage of individuals
in outpatient mental health treatment with a principal diagnosis of an adjustment disorder
ranges from approximately 5% to 20%. In a hospital psychiatric consultation setting, it is
often the most common diagno sis, frequently reaching 50%. 
Development and Course
By definition, the disturbance in adjustment disorders begins within  3 months of onset of
a stressor and lasts no longer than 6 months  after the stressor or its consequences have
ceased. If the stressor is an acute event (e.g., being fired from a job), the onset of the dis-
turbance is usually immediate (i.e., within a few days) and the durati on is relatively brief
(i.e., no more than a few mont hs). If the stressor or its co nsequences persist, the adjustment
disorder may also continue to be pr esent and become the persistent form.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,332

Risk and Prognostic Factors
Environmental. Individuals from disadvantaged lif e circumstances experience a high
rate of stressors and may be at increased risk for adjustment disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,333
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
The context of the individual’s cultural setting should be taken into account in making the
clinical judgment of whether the individual’s response to the stressor is maladaptive or
whether the associated distress is in excess of what would be expected. The nature, mean-
ing, and experience of the stressors and the ev aluation of the response to the stressors may
vary across cultures. 
Functional Consequences of Adjustment Disorders
The subjective distress or impa irment in functioning associat ed with adjustment disorders
is frequently manifested as decreased perf ormance at work or school and temporary
changes in social relationships. An adjustment disorder may complicate the course of ill-
ness in individuals who have a general medica l condition (e.g., decreased compliance with
the recommended medical regimen; incr eased length of hospital stay). 
Differential Diagnosis
Major depressive disorder. If an individual has symptoms that meet criteria for a major
depressive disorder in response  to a stressor, the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is
not applicable. The symptom profile of major depressive disorder differentiates it from ad-
justment disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,333
"Posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder. In adjustment disorders, the
stressor can be of any severity rather than of  the severity and type required by Criterion A
of acute stress disorder and posttraumatic st ress disorder (PTSD). In distinguishing ad-
justment disorders from thes e two posttraumatic diagnoses,  there are both timing and
symptom profile considerations. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed immediately
and persist up to 6 months afte r exposure to the traumatic event, whereas acute stress dis-
order can only occur between 3 days and 1 month of exposure to the stressor, and PTSD
cannot be diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed since the occurrence of the traumatic
stressor. The required symptom profile for PT SD and acute stress disorder differentiates
them from the adjustment disorders. With re gard to symptom profiles, an adjustment dis-
order may be diagnosed following a traumatic event when an individu al exhibits symptoms
of either acute stress disorder or PTSD that do not meet or exceed the diagnostic threshold
for either disorder. An adjustment disorder should also be diagno sed for individuals who
have not been exposed to a tr aumatic event but who otherwise exhibit the full symptom pro-
file of either acute st ress disorder or PTSD",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,333
"Personality disorders. With regard to personality disorders, some personality features
may be associated with a vulnerability to situat ional distress that may resemble an adjust-

terpretation of distressed behaviors to aid in  distinguishing a long-standing personality
disorder from an adjustment d isorder. In addition to some personality disorders incurring
vulnerability to distress, stre ssors may also exacerbate pers onality disorder symptoms. In
the presence of a personality disorder, if the symptom criteria for an adjustment disorder
are met, and the stress-related disturbance exceeds what may be attributable to maladap-
tive personality disorder symptoms (i.e., Crit erion C is met), then the diagnosis of an ad-

"Diagnostic Features 
The defining feature of dissocia tive identity disorder is the presence of two or more dis-
tinct personality states or an experience of  possession (Criterion  A). The overtness or
covertness of these personality states, howeve r, varies as a function of psychological
motivation, current level of st ress, culture, internal conflicts and dynamics, and emotional
resilience. Sustained periods of identity di sruption may occur when psychosocial pres-
sures are severe and/or prolonged. In many possession-form cases of  dissociative identity
disorder, and in a small proportion of non-po ssession-form cases, manifestations of alter-
nate identities are highly ove rt. Most individuals with non-possession-for m dissociative
identity disorder do not overtly display their discontinuity of identity for long periods of
time; only a small minority present to clinical attention wi th observable alternation of",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,337

identities. When alternate personality states are not directly observ ed, the disorder can be
identified by two clusters of symptoms: 1) sudden alterations or discontinuities in sense of
self and sense of agency (Criterion A), and 2)  recurrent dissociative amnesias (Criterion B)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,338
"Criterion A symptoms are related to disconti nuities of experience that can affect any
aspect of an individual’s functioning. Indivi duals with dissociative identity disorder may
report the feeling that they have suddenly  become depersonalized observers of their
“own” speech and actions, which they may feel po werless to stop (sense of self). Such in-
dividuals may also report perceptions of voices (e.g., a child’s voice; crying; the voice of a
spiritual being). In some case s, voices are experienced as multiple, perplexing, indepen-
dent thought streams over which the individual  experiences no contro l. Strong emotions,
impulses, and even speech or other actions ma y suddenly emerge, without a sense of per-
sonal ownership or control (sense of agency).  These emotions and impulses are frequently
reported as ego-dystonic and puzzling. Atti tudes, outlooks, and personal preferences
(e.g., about food, activities, dress) may sudde nly shift and then shift back. Individuals may
report that their bodies feel different (e.g.,  like a small child, like the opposite gender, huge
and muscular). Alterations in sense of self and loss of personal agency may be accompa-
nied by a feeling th at these attitudes, emotions, an d behaviors—even  one’s body—are
“not mine” and/or are “not under my control.” Although most Criterion A symptoms are
subjective, many of these sudden discontinuitie s in speech, affect, and behavior can be wit-
nessed by family, friends, or the clinician.  Non-epileptic seizures and other conversion
symptoms are prominent in some presentation s of dissociative identity disorder, espe-
cially in some non-Western settings",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,338
"The dissociative amnesia of in dividuals with dissociative id entity disorder manifests in
three primary ways: as 1) gaps in remote me mory of personal life events (e.g., periods of
childhood or adolescence; some important lif e events, such as the death of a grandparent,
getting married, giving birth); 2) lapses in  dependable memory (e.g., of what happened
today, of well-learned skills such as how to do  their job, use a computer, read, drive); and
3) discovery of evidence of their everyday ac tions and tasks that they do not recollect do-
ing (e.g., finding unexplained objects in thei r shopping bags or am ong their possessions;
finding perplexing writings or drawings that they must have created; discovering injuries;
“coming to” in the midst of doing something). Dissociative fugues, wherein the person
discovers dissociated travel, are common. Thus, individuals with dissociative identity dis-
order may report that they have suddenly found themselves at the beach, at work, in a night-
club, or somewhere at home (e.g., in the clos et, on a bed or sofa, in the corner) with no
memory of how they came to be there. Amnesia in individuals with dissociative identity dis-
order is not limited to stressful or traumati c events; these individuals often cannot recall
everyday events as well",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,338
"Individuals with dissociative identity disorder vary in their awareness and attitude to-
ward their amnesias. It is common for these in dividuals to minimize their amnestic symp-
toms. Some of their amnestic behaviors may be  apparent to others—as when these persons

remember their own name, or when they do no t recognize their spouse, children, or close

Individuals with di ssociative identity disorder typically present with comorbid depression,
anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, non-epileptic seizures, or another common symp-
tom. They often conceal, or are not fully aw are of, disruptions in consciousness, amnesia,
or other dissociative symptoms. Many individu als with dissociative identity disorder re-
port dissociative flashbacks during which they undergo a sensory reliving of a previous
event as though it were occurring in the presen t, often with a change of identity, a partial
or complete loss of contact wi th or disorientation to current  reality during the flashback,
and a subsequent amnesia for the content of the flashback. Individuals with the disorder
typically report multiple types of interpersonal maltreatment during childhood and adult-
hood. Nonmaltreatment forms of overwhelming early life events, such as multiple long,
painful, early-life medical pr ocedures, also may be reported. Self-mutilation and suicidal
behavior are frequent. On standardized meas ures, these individuals report higher levels
of hypnotizability and dissociativity compared with other clinical groups and healthy con-
trol subjects. Some individuals experience transient psychotic phenomena or episodes",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,339

Development and Course
Dissociative identity disorder is associated  with overwhelming experiences, traumatic
events, and/or abuse oc curring in childhood. The full disorder may first manifest at al-
most any age (from earliest childhood to late life). Dissociation in children may generate
problems with memory, concentration, attach ment, and traumatic play . Nevertheless, chil-
dren usually do not present with  identity changes; instead they present primarily with over-
lap and interference among mental states (Cri terion A phenomena), with symptoms related
to discontinuities of experience. Sudden changes in identity during adolescence may ap-
pear to be just adolescent turmoil or the ea rly stages of another mental disorder. Older
individuals may present to treatment with what appear to be late-life mood disorders, ob-
sessive-compulsive disorder, paranoia, psycho tic mood disorders, or even cognitive dis-
orders due to dissociative amnesia. In some  cases, disruptive affects and memories may
increasingly intrude into aw areness with advancing age. 
Psychological decompensation and overt change s in identity may be triggered by 1) re-
moval from the traumatizing situation (e.g.,  through leaving home); 2) the individual’s
children reaching the same age at which the in dividual was originally abused or trauma-
tized; 3) later traumatic experiences, even seemingly inconsequential ones, like a minor
motor vehicle accident; or 4) th e death of, or the onset of a fatal illness in, their abuser(s)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,339

"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
Many features of dissociative identity disord er can be influenced by the individual’s cul-
tural background. Individuals with this disorder may pres ent with prominent medically
unexplained neurological symptoms, such as no n-epileptic seizures, paralyses, or sensory
loss, in cultural settings where such symptoms are common. Similarly, in settings where
normative possession is common (e.g., rural areas in the developing world, among certain
religious groups in the United States and Euro pe), the fragmented identities may take the
form of possessing spirits, de ities, demons, animals, or myth ical figures. Acculturation or
prolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of  the other identities (e.g.,
identities in India may speak English exclu sively and wear Western clothes). Possession-
form dissociative identity diso rder can be distinguished from  culturally accepted posses-
sion states in that the former is involunta ry, distressing, uncontro llable, and often recur-
rent or persistent; involves conflict between  the individual and his or her surrounding
family, social, or work milieu; and is manifest ed at times and in places that violate the
norms of the culture or religion. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Females with dissociative identity disorder pr edominate in adult clinical settings but not
in child clinical settings. Adult males with dissociative identity disorder may deny their
symptoms and trauma  histories, and this can lead to el evated rates of false negative di-
agnosis. Females with dissociative identity di sorder present more frequently with acute
dissociative states (e.g., flashb acks, amnesia, fugue, function al neurological [conversion]
symptoms, hallucinations, self-mutilation). Ma les commonly exhibit more criminal or vi-
olent behavior than females; among males, comm on triggers of acute dissociative states in-
clude combat, prison conditions, and physical or sexual assaults",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,340
"Suicide Risk
Over 70% of outpatients with dissociative id entity disorder have attempted suicide; mul-
tiple attempts are common, and other self-inj urious behavior is frequent. Assessment of
suicide risk may be complicated when there is amnesia for past suicid al behavior or when
the presenting identity does no t feel suicidal and is unaware that other dissociated iden-
tities do. 
Functional Consequences of 
Dissociative Identity Disorder
Impairment varies widely, from apparently minimal (e.g., in high-functioning profession-
als) to profound. Regardless of level of disability, individuals with dissociative identity
disorder commonly minimize the impact of their dissociative an d posttraumatic symp-
toms. The symptoms of higher-functioning in dividuals may impair their relational, mar-
ital, family, and parenting functions more th an their occupational and professional life
(although the latter also may be affected). With appropriate treatment, many impaired in-
dividuals show marked improvement in occupational and personal functioning. How-
ever, some remain highly impaired in most ac tivities of living. These individuals may only
respond to treatment very slowly, with gr adual reduction in or improved tolerance of",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,340

tive identity disorder often has an importan t feature: the depressed mood and cognitions fluc-
tuate  because they are experienced in some identity states but not others. 
Bipolar disorders. Individuals with dissociative iden tity disorder are often misdiag-
nosed with a bipolar disorder, mo st often bipolar II disorder. The relatively rapid shifts in
mood in individuals with this disorder—typica lly within minutes or hours, in contrast to
the slower mood changes typically seen in individuals with bipolar disorders—are due to
the rapid, subjective shifts in  mood commonly reported acro ss dissociative states, some-
times accompanied by fluctuation in levels of activation. Furtherm ore, in dissociative
identity disorder, elevated or depressed mood  may be displayed in conjunction with overt

lish the presence or absence of dissociative sy mptoms that are not characteristic of acute
stress disorder or PTSD. Some individuals wi th PTSD manifest diss ociative symptoms that
also occur in dissociative identity disorder: 1) amnesia for some aspe cts of trauma, 2) dis-
sociative flashbacks (i.e., reliving of the trauma, with reduced awareness of one’s current
orientation), and 3) symptoms of intrusion an d avoidance, negative alterations in cogni-
tion and mood, and hyperarousal that are focu sed around the traumatic event. On the other
hand, individuals with dissociative identity disorder manifest dissociative symptoms that
are not a manifestation of PTSD: 1) amnesias for many everyday (i.e., nontraumatic) events,
2) dissociative flashbacks that may be followe d by amnesia for the content of the flashback,

to cry with my eyes”). Persecutory and derogato ry internal voices in dissociative identity
disorder associated with depressive symptoms  may be misdiagnosed as major depression
with psychotic features. Chaotic identity change and acute intrusions that disrupt thought
processes may be distinguished from brief psychotic disorder by the predominance of dis-
sociative symptoms and amnesia for the episode,  and diagnostic evaluation after cessation

"Diagnostic Features
The defining characteristic of dissociative amnesia is an inability to recall important auto-
biographical information that 1) should be su ccessfully stored in me mory and 2) ordinar-
ily would be readily remembered (Criterion  A). Dissociative amnesia differs from the
permanent amnesias due to neurob iological damage or toxicity that prevent memory stor-
age or retrieval in that it is always potentially reversible because the memory has been suc-
cessfully stored. 
Localized amnesia,  a failure to recall events during a circumscribed period of time, is the
most common form of dissocia tive amnesia. Localized amnesi a may be broader than am-
nesia for a single traumatic event (e.g., months or years associated with child abuse or in-
tense combat). In selective amnesia,  the individual can recall some , but not all, of the events
during a circumscribed period of time. Thus, the individual may remember part of a trau-
matic event but not other parts. Some individu als report both localized and selective am-
nesias. 
Generalized amnesia,  a complete loss of memory for one’ s life history, is rare. Individuals
with generalized amnesia may forget personal  identity. Some lose previous knowledge
about the world (i.e., semantic knowledge) and can no longer access well-learned skills",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,343
"Dissociative Amnesia 299
(i.e., procedural knowledge). Generalized amnesia has an acute onset; the perplexity, dis-
orientation, and purposeless wandering of individuals with generalized amnesia usually
bring them to the attention of the police or psychiatric emergency services. Generalized
amnesia may be more common among combat veterans, sexual  assault victims, and indi-
viduals experiencing extreme emotional stress or conflict. 
Individuals with dissociative amnesia are fr equently unaware (or only partially aware)
of their memory problems. Many, especially those with localized am nesia, minimize the
importance of their memory loss and may be come uncomfortable when prompted to ad-
dress it. In systematized amnesia,  the individual loses memory for a specific category of in-
formation (e.g., all memories relating to on e’s family, a particular person, or childhood
sexual abuse). In continuous amnesia,  an individual forgets each new event as it occurs",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,344
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Many individuals with dissociative amnesia are chronically impaired in their ability to
form and sustain satisfactory relationships. Histories of trauma, child abuse, and victim-
ization are common. Some indivi duals with dissociative amnesia report dissociative flash-
backs (i.e., behavioral reexperiencing of trau matic events). Many have a history of self-
mutilation, suicide attempts, and other high -risk behaviors. Depressive and functional
neurological symptoms are common, as are depersonalization, auto-hypnotic symptoms,
and high hypnotizability. Sexual dysfunctions are common. Mild traumatic brain injury
may precede dissociative amnesia. 
Prevalence
The 12-month prevalence for dissociative amnesia among ad ults in a small U.S. commu-
nity study was 1.8% (1.0% fo r males; 2.6% for females). 
Development and Course
Onset of generalized amnesia is usually sudden . Less is known about the onset of localized
and selective amnesias because these amnesias ar e seldom evident, even to the individual",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,344
"Although overwhelming or intolerable events typically precede localized amnesia, its on-
set may be delayed for ho urs, days, or longer. 
Individuals may report multiple episodes of dissociative amnesia. A single episode
may predispose to future episodes. In between episodes of amnesia, the individual may or
may not appear to be acutely symptomatic. Th e duration of the forgotten events can range
from minutes to decades. Some episodes of  dissociative amnesia resolve rapidly (e.g.,
when the person is removed from combat or some other stressful situation), whereas other
episodes persist for long periods of time. So me individuals may grad ually recall the dis-
sociated memories years later. Dissociative capacities may decline with age, but not al-
ways. As the amnesia remits, there may be considerable distress, su icidal behavior, and
symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Dissociative amnesia has been observed in young children, adolescents, and adults",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,344
"Children may be the most difficult to evaluate because they often have difficulty under-
standing questions about amnesia, and interviewers may find it difficult to formulate child-
friendly questions about memory and amnesia. Observations of apparent dissociative am-
nesia are often difficult to differentiate from inattention, absorption , anxiety, oppositional
behavior, and learning disorders. Reports fr om several different sources (e.g., teacher,
therapist, case worker) may be needed  to diagnose amnesia in children. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Environmental. Single or repeated traumatic experiences (e.g., war, childhood maltreat-
ment, natural disaster, internment in conc entration camps, genocide) are common ante-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,344
"300 Dissociative Disorders
cedents. Dissociative amnesia is more likely to  occur with 1) a greater number of adverse
childhood experiences, particularly physical and/or sexual abuse, 2) interpersonal vio-
lence; and 3) increased severity, frequency, and violence of the trauma. 
Genetic and physiological. There are no genetic studies of  dissociative amnesia. Stud-
ies of dissociation report significant genetic an d environmental factors in both clinical and
nonclinical samples. 
Course modifiers. Removal from the traumatic circumstances underlying the dissociative
amnesia (e.g., combat) may bring about a rapid re turn of memory. The memory loss of indi-
viduals with dissociative fugue may be particularly refractory. Onset of PTSD symptoms may
decrease localized, selective, or systematized amnesia. The returning memory, however, may
be experienced as flashbacks that alternate wi th amnesia for the content of the flashbacks. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
In Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, non-epileptic seizures and other functional
neurological symptoms may accompany dissociat ive amnesia. In cultur es with highly re-
strictive social traditions, th e precipitants of dissociative  amnesia often do not involve
frank trauma. Instead, the amnesia is preceded by severe psychological stresses or con-
flicts (e.g., marital conflict, other family d isturbances, attachment problems, conflicts due
to restriction or oppression). 
Suicide Risk
Suicidal and other self-destructive behavior s are common in individuals with dissociative
amnesia. Suicidal behavior may be a particular risk when the amnesia remits suddenly
and overwhelms the individual  with intolerable memories",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,345
"Functional Consequences of Dissociative Amnesia

order report pervasive disconti nuities in sense of self and agency, accompanied by many
other dissociative symptoms. The amnesias of individuals with localized, selective, and/
or systematized dissociative amnesias are relatively stable. Amnesias in dissociative iden-
tity disorder include amnesia for everyday events, finding of unexplained possessions,
sudden fluctuations in skills and knowledge, ma jor gaps in recall of life history, and brief
amnesic gaps in interpersonal interactions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,345
"Posttraumatic stress disorder. Some individuals with PTSD cannot recall part or all of
a specific traumatic event (e.g., a rape victim  with depersonalization and/or derealization
symptoms who cannot recall most events for the entire day of the rape). When that amne-
sia extends beyond the immediat e time of the trauma, a comorbid diagnosis of dissociative
amnesia is warranted. 
Neurocognitive disorders. In neurocognitive disorders, memory loss for personal infor-
mation is usually embedded in cognitive, lingu istic, affective, atte ntional, and behavioral",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,345

disturbances. In dissociative amnesia, memory  deficits are primarily for autobiographical
information; intellectual and co gnitive abilities are preserved. 
Substance-related disorders. In the context of repeated intoxication with alcohol or
other substances/medications, there may be episod es of “black outs” or periods for which the
individual has no memory. To aid in distingu ishing these episodes from dissociative am-
nesia, a longitudinal history noting that the amnestic episodes occur only in the context of
intoxication and do no t occur in other situations would help identify the source as sub-
stance-induced; however the distinction may be difficult when the individual with dis-
sociative amnesia may also misuse alcohol or other substances in the context of stressful
situations that may also exac erbate dissociative symptoms. Some individuals with comor-
bid dissociative amnesia and substance use disorders will at tribute their memory prob-
lems solely to the substance use. Prolonged us e of alcohol or other substances may result in
a substance-induced neurocognitive disorder that may be associated with impaired cog-
nitive function, but in this co ntext the protracted history of  substance use and the persis-
tent deficits associated with the neurocognitive disorder would serve to distinguish it
from dissociative amnesia, wher e there is typically no evidence of persistent impairment in
intellectual functioning",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,346
"Posttraumatic amnesia due to brain injury. Amnesia may occur in th e context of a trau-
matic brain injury (TBI) when th ere has been an impact to th e head or other mechanisms of
rapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull TBI. Other characteristics of
TBI include loss of consciousness, disorientati on and confusion, or, in more severe cases,
neurological signs (e.g., abnormalities on neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked
worsening of a preexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anos mia). A neurocognitive
disorder attributable to TBI must present either  immediately after brain injury occurs or im-
mediately after the individual recovers consciousness after th e injury, and persist past the
acute post-injury period. The cognitive presenta tion of a neurocognitive disorder following
TBI is variable and includes difficulties in the domains of complex attention, executive func-
tion, learning and memory as well as slowed speed of information processing and distur-
bances in social cognition. Th ese additional features help di stinguish it from dissociative
amnesia. 
Seizure disorders. Individuals with seizure disorders may exhibit complex behavior dur-
ing seizures or post-ictally wi th subsequent amnesia. Some individuals with a seizure disorder
engage in nonpurposive wandering that is lim ited to the period of seizure activity. Con-
versely, behavior during a di ssociative fugue is usually purposeful, complex, and goal-
directed and may last for days, weeks, or long er. Occasionally, individuals with a seizure dis-
order will report that earlier autobiographical me mories have been “wiped out” as the seizure
disorder progresses. Such  memory loss is not associated with traumatic circumstances and ap-
pears to occur randomly. Serial electroencepha lograms usually show abnormalities. Telemet-
ric electroencephalographic monitoring usually shows an association between the episodes of
amnesia and seizure activity. Dissociativ e and epileptic amnesias may coexist",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,346

uals with 1) acute, florid dissociative amnesia; 2) financial, sexual, or legal problems; or 3) a
wish to escape stressful circumstances. True amnesia can be associated with those same cir-

"Comorbidity
As dissociative amnesia begins  to remit, a wide variety of  affective phenomena may sur-
face: dysphoria, grief, rage, shame, guilt, psychological conf lict and turmoil, and suicidal
and homicidal ideation, impulses, and acts. These individuals may have symptoms that
then meet diagnostic criteria  for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia); major de-
pressive disorder; other specified or unspec ified depressive disord er; adjustment disor-
der, with depressed mood; or adjustment disorder, with mixed disturbance of emotions
and conduct. Many individuals with dissociative amnesia develop PTSD at some point
during their life, especially when the traumatic antecedent s of their amnesia are brought
into conscious awareness. 
Many individuals with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet diagnostic cri-
teria for a comorbid somatic symptom or related disorder (and vice versa), including so-
matic symptom disorder and conversion di sorder (functional neurological symptom
disorder). Many individuals with dissociative  amnesia have symptoms  that meet diagnos-
tic criteria for a personality disorder, especially dependent, avoidant, and borderline. 
Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder
Diagnostic Criteria 300.6 (F48.1)
A. The presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealiza-
tion, or both:
1.Depersonalization:  Experiences of unreality, detachment, or being an outside ob-
server with respect to one’s thoughts, feelings, sensations, body, or actions (e.g.,
perceptual alterations, distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emotional and/
or physical numbing)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,347
"2.Derealization:  Experiences of unreality or detachment with respect to surround-
ings (e.g., individuals or objects are ex perienced as unreal, dreamlike, foggy, life-
less, or visually distorted)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,347
"B. During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality testing remains intact",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,347
"C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functioning",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,347
"D. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
drug of abuse, medication) or another medical condition (e.g., seizures)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,347
"E. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as schizo-
phrenia, panic disorder, major depressive di sorder, acute stress disorder, posttrau-
matic stress disorder, or another dissociative disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,347
"Diagnostic Features
The essential features of depe rsonalization/derealization diso rder are persistent or recur-
rent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Episodes of depersonalization
are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, one’s
whole self or from aspects of the self (Cri terion A1). The indivi dual may feel detached
from his or her entire being (e.g., “I am no on e,” “I have no self”). He or she may also feel
subjectively detached from aspects of the self , including feelings (e.g., hypoemotionality:",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,347
"Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder 303
“I know I have feelings but I don’t feel them”), thoughts (e.g., “My thoughts don’t feel like
my own,” “head filled with cotton ”), whole body or body parts, or sensations (e.g., touch,
proprioception, hunger, thirst, libido). There may also be a diminished sense of agency
(e.g., feeling robotic, like an automaton; lacking control of one’s speech or movements)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,348
"The depersonalization experience can sometimes be one of a split self, with one part ob-
serving and one participating, known as an “o ut-of-body experience” in its most extreme
form. The unitary symptom of “depersonalization” consists of several symptom factors:
anomalous body experiences (i.e., unreality of  the self and perceptual alterations); emo-
tional or physical numbing; an d temporal distortions with anomalous subjective recall. 
Episodes of derealization are characterize d by a feeling of unreality or detachment
from, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surround-
ings (Criterion A2). The individual may feel as if he or she were in a fog, dream, or bubble, or
as if there were a veil or a glass wall between the individual and world around. Surround-
ings may be experienced as artificial, colorles s, or lifeless. Derealization is commonly ac-
companied by subjective visual distortions, su ch as blurriness, heig htened acuity, widened
or narrowed visual field, two-dimensionalit y or flatness, exaggerated three-dimensional-
ity, or altered distance or size of objects (i.e ., macropsia or micropsia). Auditory distortions
can also occur, whereby voices or sounds ar e muted or heightened. In addition, Criterion
C requires the presence of clinically signific ant distress or impairment in social, occupa-
tional, or other important areas of functionin g, and Criteria D and E describe exclusionary
diagnoses. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with depersonalization/derealizat ion disorder may have difficulty describ-
ing their symptoms and may think they are “crazy” or “going crazy”. Another common
experience is the fear of irreversible brai n damage. A commonly associated symptom is a
subjectively altered sense of time (i.e., too fast  or too slow), as well as a subjective difficulty
in vividly recalling past memories and owning  them as personal and emotional. Vague so-
matic symptoms, such as head fullness, ting ling, or lightheadedne ss, are not uncommon",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,348
"Individuals may suffer extreme rumination or  obsessional preoccupation (e.g., constantly
obsessing about whether they really exist, or checking their perc eptions to determine
whether they appear real). Varying degrees of  anxiety and depression are also common as-
sociated features. Individuals with the disord er have been found to have physiological
hyporeactivity to emotional stimuli. Neural substrates of interest include the hypotha-
lamic-pituitary-adrenocortical ax is, inferior parietal lobule, and prefrontal cortical-limbic
circuits",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,348
"Prevalence
Transient depersonalization/derealization sy mptoms lasting hours to days are common
in the general population. The 12-month prev alence of depersonalization/derealization
disorder is thought to be markedly less than  for transient symptoms, although precise es-
timates for the disorder are unavailable. In general, approximately one-half of all adults
have experienced at least one lifetime episode of depersonalization/derealization. How-
ever, symptomatology that meets full criter ia for depersonalization/derealization disor-
der is markedly less common than transient sy mptoms. Lifetime prevalence in U.S. and
non-U.S. countries is approximat ely 2% (range of 0.8% to 2. 8%). The gender ratio for the
disorder is 1:1",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,348

The mean age at onset of depersonalization/derealization disorder is 16 years, although the
disorder can start in early or middle childhood; a minority cannot recall ever not having had",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,348

the symptoms. Less than 20% of individuals experience onset after age 20 years and only
5% after age 25 years. Onset in the fourth decade of life or later is highly unusual. Onset can
range from extremely sudden to gradual. Du ration of depersonalization/derealization
disorder episodes can vary greatly, from brief (hours or days) to prolonged (weeks,
months, or years). Given the rari ty of disorder onset after age 40 years, in such cases the in-
dividual should be examined more closely fo r underlying medical conditions (e.g., brain
lesions, seizure disorders, sl eep apnea). The course of the disorder is often persistent",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,349
"About one-third of cases involve discrete episodes; another third, continuous symptoms
from the start; and still another third, an initially episodic co urse that even tually becomes
continuous. 
While in some individuals the intensity of symptoms can wax and wane considerably,
others report an unwavering level of intensity that in extreme cases can be constantly pres-
ent for years or decades. Internal and extern al factors that affect  symptom intensity vary
between individuals, yet some typical pattern s are reported. Exacerbations can be trig-
gered by stress, worsening mood or anxiety symptoms, novel or over stimulating settings,
and physical factors such as lighting or lack of sleep. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Individuals with depersonalization/ derealization disorder are charac-
terized by harm-avoidant temperament, imma ture defenses, and both disconnection and
overconnection schemata. Imma ture defenses such as idea lization/devaluation, projec-
tion and acting out result in deni al of reality and poor adaptation. Cognitive disconnection
schemata  reflect defectiveness and emotional inhibi tion and subsume themes of abuse, ne-
glect, and deprivation. Overconnection schemata  involve impaired autonomy with themes
of dependency, vulnerability, and incompetence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,349
"Environmental. There is a clear association between the disorder and childhood interper-
sonal traumas in a substantial portion of individu als, although this association is not as prev-
alent or as extreme in the nature of the trau mas as in other dissociative disorders, such as
dissociative identity disorder. In particular, emotional abuse and emotional neglect have been
most strongly and consistently associated with  the disorder. Other st ressors can include phys-
ical abuse; witnessing domestic  violence; growing up with a se riously impaired, mentally ill
parent; or unexpected de ath or suicide of a family member or close friend. Sexual abuse is a
much less common antecedent but can be encountered. The most common proximal precipi-
tants of the disorder are severe stress (interpersonal, financ ial, occupational), depression, anx-
iety (particularly panic attacks), and illicit drug  use. Symptoms may be specifically induced by
substances such as tetrahydrocannabinol, ha llucinogens, ketamine, MDMA (3,4-methylene-
dioxymethamphetamine; “ecstasy ”) and salvia. Marijuana use may precipitate new-onset
panic attacks and depersonalization/derealization symptoms simultaneously",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,349
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Volitionally induced experiences of depersonalization/dereali zation can be a part of med-
itative practices that are prevalent in many religions and cult ures and should not be diag-
nosed as a disorder. However, there are in dividuals who initially induce these states
intentionally but over time lose control over  them and may develop a fear and aversion for
related practices.

sociated with major morbidity. The affectivel y flattened and robotic demeanor that these",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,349

individuals often demonstrate may appear incongruent with the extreme emotional pain
reported by those with the disorder. Impairment is often experienced in both interpersonal
and occupational spheres, largel y due to the hypoemotionality with others, subjective diffi-
culty in focusing and retaining information, and a general sense of disconnectedness from
life. 
Differential Diagnosis
Illness anxiety disorder. Although individuals with depersonalization/derealization dis-
order can present with vague somatic complaints as well as fears of permanent brain dam-
age, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by the
presence of a constellation of typical depersonalization/derealization symptoms and the ab-
sence of other manifestations  of illness anxiety disorder. 
Major depressive disorder. Feelings of numbness, deadne ss, apathy, and being in a
dream are not uncommon in major depressive  episodes. However, in depersonalization/
derealization disorder, such symptoms are a ssociated with further symptoms of the dis-
order. If the depersonalization/derealization clearly precedes the onset of a major depres-
sive episode or clearly continues after its resolution, the diagnosis of depersonalization/
derealization disorder applies. 
Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some individuals with depersonalization/dereal-
ization disorder can become obsessively preo ccupied with their subjective experience or
develop rituals checking on the status of their symptoms. However, other symptoms of
obsessive-compulsive disorder  unrelated to depersonali zation/derealization are not
present. 
Other dissociative disorders. In order to diagnose depersonalization/derealization
disorder, the symptoms should not occur in th e context of another dissociative disorder,
such as dissociative identity disorder. Differentiation from dissociative amnesia and con-
version disorder (functional neurological sy mptom disorder) is simpler, as the symptoms
of these disorders do not overlap with those of depersonalization/derealization disorder. 
Anxiety disorders. Depersonalization/derealization is one of the symptoms of panic at-
tacks, increasingly common as panic attack severity increases. Therefore, depersonal-
ization/derealization disorder should not be diagnosed when the symptoms occur only
during panic attacks that are part of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, or specific
phobia. In addition, it is not uncommon for depersonalization/derealization symptoms
to first begin in the context of new-onset pani c attacks or as panic disorder progresses and
worsens. In such presentations, the diagno sis of depersonalization/ derealization disorder
can be made if 1) the depersonalization/de realization component of  the presentation is
very prominent from the start, clearly exceed ing in duration and intensity the occurrence
of actual panic attacks; or 2) the depersona lization/derealization continues after panic dis-
order has remitted or has be en successfully treated. 
Psychotic disorders. The presence of intact reality testing specifically regarding the
depersonalization/derealization symptoms is essential to differentiating depersonal-
ization/derealization disord er from psychotic disorder s. Rarely, positive-symptom
schizophrenia can pose a diagnostic challenge when nihilistic delusions are present. For
example, an individual may complain that he or she is dead or the world is not real; this
could be either a subjective experience that the individual knows is not true or a delusional
conviction",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,350
"Substance/medication-induced disorders. Depersonalization/dere alization associated

about 15% of all cases of depersonalization/derealization disorder, the symptoms are pre-
cipitated by ingestion of such substances. If the symptoms persist for some time in the ab-
sence of any further substance or medication  use, the diagnosis of depersonalization/
derealization disorder applies. This diagnosis is usually easy to establish since the vast ma-
jority of individuals with this presentation become highly phobic and aversive to the trig-
gering substance and do not use it again",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,351
"Mental disorders due to another medical condition. Features such as onset after age
40 years or the presence of atypical symptoms  and course in any individual suggest the
possibility of an underlying medical condition. In such cases, it is essential to conduct a
thorough medical and neurological evaluation, which may include standard laboratory
studies, viral titers, an electroencephalogram, ve stibular testing, visual testing, sleep stud-
ies, and/or brain imaging. When the suspicion of an underlying seizure disorder proves
difficult to confirm, an ambulatory electr oencephalogram may be indicated; although

"309Somatic Symptom and
Related Disorders
Somatic symptom disorder  and other disorders with  prominent somatic symp-
toms constitute a new ca tegory in DSM-5 called somatic symptom an d related disorders.  This
chapter includes the diagnoses of somatic sy mptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, con-
version disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affect-
ing other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and
related disorder, and unspecified somatic symp tom and related disorder. All of the disor-
ders in this chapter share a common feature: the prominence of soma tic symptoms associ-
ated with significant distress and impairment . Individuals with diso rders with prominent
somatic symptoms are commonly encountered in primary care and other medical settings
but are less commonly encountered in psychiatric and other mental health settings. These
reconceptualized diagnoses, based on a reorga nization of DSM-IV somatoform disorder di-
agnoses, are more useful for primary care and other medical (nonpsychiatric) clinicians",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,354
"The major diagnosis in this diagnostic cl ass, somatic symptom disorder, emphasizes
diagnosis made on the basis of positive sy mptoms and signs (distressing somatic symp-
toms plus abnormal thoughts,  feelings, and behaviors in response to these symptoms)
rather than the absence of a medical explanat ion for somatic symptoms. A distinctive char-
acteristic of many individuals with somati c symptom disorder is not the somatic symp-
toms per se, but instead the way they present and interpret them. Incorporating affective,
cognitive, and behavioral components into th e criteria for somatic symptom disorder pro-
vides a more comprehensive and accurate reflecti on of the true clinical picture than can be
achieved by assessing the somatic complaints alone",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,354
"The principles behind the changes in the somatic symptom and related diagnoses from
DSM-IV are crucial in understanding th e DSM-5 diagnoses. The DSM-IV term somatoform
disorders  was confusing and is replaced by somatic symptom and related disorders . In DSM-IV
there was a great deal of over lap across the somatoform disorders and a lack of clarity
about the boundaries of diag noses. Although individuals wi th these disorders primarily
present in medical rather than mental health  settings, nonpsychiatric physicians found the
DSM-IV somatoform diagnoses difficult to understand and use. The current DSM-5 clas-
sification recognizes this overlap by reducing the total number of disorders as well as their
subcategories",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,354
The previous criteria overemphasized the cent rality of medically unexplained symptoms,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,354
"Such symptoms are present to various degrees, particularly in conver sion disorder, but so-
matic symptom disorders can also accompany diagnosed medical disorders. The reli-
ability of determining that a somatic sympto m is medically unexplai ned is limited, and
grounding a diagnosis on the absence of an  explanation is problematic and reinforces
mind-body dualism. It is not appropriate to give  an individual a mental disorder diagnosis
solely because a medical cause cannot be demo nstrated. Furthermore, the presence of a
medical diagnosis does not exclude the possibility of a comorbid ment al disorder, includ-
ing a somatic symptom and related disorder. Perhaps because of the predominant focus
on lack of medical explanation, individuals re garded these diagnoses as pejorative and de-
meaning, implying that their physical symp toms were not “real.” The new classification
defines the major diagnosis, somatic symptom d isorder, on the basis of positive symptoms

to these symptoms). However, medically unexplained symptoms remain a key feature in
conversion disorder and pseu docyesis (other specified somatic symptom and related dis-
order) because it is possible to demonstrate de finitively in such disorders that the symp-
toms are not consistent with medical pathophysiology",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,355
"It is important to note that some other ment al disorders may initially manifest with pri-
marily somatic symptoms (e.g., major depressi ve disorder, panic disorder). Such diagno-
ses may account for the somatic symptoms, or they may occur alongside one of the somatic
symptom and related diso rders in this chapter. There is also considerable medical comor-
bidity among somatizing individuals. Althou gh somatic symptoms are frequently associ-
ated with psychological distress and psyc hopathology, some somatic symptom and
related disorders can arise spontaneously, and their causes can remain obscure. Anxiety
disorders and depressive disorders may acco mpany somatic symptom and related disor-
ders. The somatic component adds severity an d complexity to depressive and anxiety dis-
orders and results in higher severity, functi onal impairment, and ev en refractoriness to
traditional treatments. In rare instances, the degree of preoccupation may be so severe as
to warrant consideration of a delusional disorder diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,355
"A number of factors may contribute to so matic symptom and related disorders. These
include genetic and biological vulnerability (e.g., increased sensitivity to pain), early trau-
matic experiences (e.g., violence, abuse, deprivation), and learning (e.g., attention ob-
tained from illness, lack of reinforcement of nonsomatic expressions of distress), as well as
cultural/social norms that devalue and stig matize psychological suffering as compared
with physical suffering. Differences in medical care across cultures affect the presentation,
recognition, and management of these somatic presentations. Variations in symptom pre-
sentation are likely the result of the interact ion of multiple factors within cultural con-
texts that affect how individuals identify and classify bodily sensations, perceive illness,
and seek medical attention for them. Thus, somatic presentations can be viewed as expres-
sions of personal suffering inserted  in a cultural and social context",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,355
"All of these disorders are characterized by  the prominent focus on somatic concerns
and their initial presentation mainly in medical rather than mental health care settings. So-
matic symptom disorder offers a more clinica lly useful method of characterizing individ-
uals who may have been considered in the pa st for a diagnosis of somatization disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,355
"Furthermore, approximately 75% of individuals previously  diagnosed with hypochon-
driasis are subsumed under the diagnosis of  somatic symptom diso rder. Howe ver, about
25% of individuals with hypoch ondriasis have high health anxiety in the absence of so-
matic symptoms, and many such individuals’ symptoms would not qualify for an anxiety
disorder diagnosis. The DSM-5 diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder is for this latter group
of individuals. Illness anxiety disorder can be considered eith er in this diagnostic section
or as an anxiety disorder. Because of the st rong focus on somatic concerns, and because ill-
ness anxiety disorder is most often encountere d in medical settings, for utility it is listed
with the somatic symptom and re lated disorders. In conversion  disorder, the essential fea-
ture is neurological symptoms that are foun d, after appropriate neurological assessment,
to be incompatible with neurological pathophysiology. Psychological factors affecting
other medical conditions is also included in th is chapter. Its essential feature is the pres-
ence of one or more clinically significant psyc hological or behavioral factors that adversely
affect a medical condition by increasing the risk  for suffering, death, or disability. Like the
other somatic symptom and related disorders,  factitious disorder embodies persistent
problems related to illness percep tion and identity. In the great majority of reported cases
of factitious disorder, both imposed on self and imposed on another, individuals present
with somatic symptoms and medical disease convi ction. C onsequently, DSM-5 factitious
disorder is included among the somatic symp tom and related disorders. Other specified
somatic symptom and related disorder and un specified somatic symptom and related dis-
order include conditions for which some, but no t all, of the criteria for somatic symptom
disorder or illness anxiety disord er are met, as well as pseudocyesis.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,355

"Diagnostic Features
Individuals with somatic symptom disorder ty pically have multiple, current, somatic symp-
toms that are distressing or result in signific ant disruption of daily life (Criterion A), al-
though sometimes only one severe symptom,  most commonly pain, is present. Symptoms
may be specific (e.g., localized pain) or rela tively nonspecific (e.g., fatigue). The symptoms
sometimes represent normal bodi ly sensations or discomfort that does not generally sig-
nify serious disease. Somatic symptoms with out an evident medical explanation are not
sufficient to make this diagnosis. The individu al’s suffering is authen tic, whether or not it
is medically explained",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,356
"The symptoms may or may not be associated  with another medical condition. The di-
agnoses of somatic symptom disorder and a concurrent medical illness are not mutually
exclusive, and these frequently occur together . For example, an indi vidual may become se-
riously disabled by symptoms of somatic sy mptom disorder after an uncomplicated myo-
cardial infarction even if the myocardial infarc tion itself did not result in any disability. If
another medical condition or high risk for de veloping one is present (e.g., strong family
history), the thoughts, feelings, and behavior s associated with this condition are excessive
(Criterion B)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,356
"Individuals with somatic symptom disorder tend to have very high levels of worry
about illness (Criterion B). They appraise th eir bodily symptoms as unduly threatening,
harmful, or troublesome and often think the worst about their health. Even when there is
evidence to the contrary, some patients sti ll fear the medical seriousness of their symp-
toms. In severe somatic symptom disorder, he alth concerns may assume a central role in
the individual’s life, becoming a feature of his or her identity and dominating interper-
sonal relationships.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,356
"312 Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders
Individuals typically experience distress that  is principally focused on somatic symp-
toms and their significance. When asked direct ly about their distress, some individuals de-
scribe it in relation to other aspects of thei r lives, while others deny any source of distress
other than the somatic symptoms. Health-relat ed quality of life is often impaired, both
physically and mentally. In severe somatic symptom disorder, the impairment is marked,
and when persistent, the diso rder can lead to invalidism",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,357
"There is often a high level of medical care utilization, which rarely alleviates the individ-
ual’s concerns. Consequently, the patient may se ek care from multiple doctors for the same
symptoms. These individuals often seem unre sponsive to medical interventions, and new
interventions may only exacerbate the presenting symptoms . Some individuals with the dis-
order seem unusually sensitive to medication si de effects. Some feel that their medical as-
sessment and treatment have been inadequate. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Cognitive features include at tention focused on somatic symptoms, attribution of normal
bodily sensations to physical illness (possibly with catastrophic interpretations), worry
about illness, and fear that any physical activity may damage the body. The relevant as-
sociated behavioral features may include repe ated bodily checking for abnormalities, re-
peated seeking of medical help and reassurance, and avoidance of physical activity. These
behavioral features are most pronounced in severe, persistent somatic symptom disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,357
"These features are usually associated with freq uent requests for medical help for different
somatic symptoms. This may lead to medical consultations in which individuals are so fo-
cused on their concerns about somatic symptom( s) that they cannot be redirected to other
matters. Any reassurance by the doctor that the symptoms are not indicative of serious
physical illness tends to be short-lived and/ or is experienced by the individuals as the
doctor not taking their sympto ms with due seriousness. As  the focus on somatic symp-
toms is a primary feature of the disorder, in dividuals with somatic symptom disorder typ-
ically present to general medical health servic es rather than mental health services. The
suggestion of referral to a mental health spec ialist may be met with surprise or even frank
refusal by individuals with somatic symptom disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,357
"Since somatic symptom disorder is associated with depressive disorders, there is an in-
creased suicide risk. It is not known whethe r somatic symptom disorder is associated with
suicide risk independent of its asso ciation with depressive disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,357
"Prevalence 
The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is not known. However, the prevalence of
somatic symptom disorder is expected to be higher than that of the more restrictive DSM-
IV somatization disorder (<1%) but lower than  that of undifferentiated somatoform dis-
order (approximately 19%). The prevalence of  somatic symptom disorder in the general
adult population may be around 5%–7%. Fema les tend to report more somatic symptoms
than do males, and the preval ence of somatic symptom diso rder is consequently likely to
be higher in females",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,357
"Development and Course
In older individuals, somatic symptoms and concurrent medical illnesses are common,
and a focus on Criterion B is crucial for making the diagnosis. Somatic symptom disorder
may be underdiagnosed in older adults either because certain somatic symptoms (e.g.,
pain, fatigue) are considered part of normal aging or because illness worry is considered
“understandable” in older adults who have  more general medical illnesses and medica-
tions than do younger people. Concurrent de pressive disorder is common in older people
who present with numerous somatic symptoms.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,357
"Somatic Symptom Disorder 313
In children, the most common  symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain, headache, fa-
tigue, and nausea. A single  prominent symptom is more common in children than in
adults. While young children may have somatic complaints, they rarely worry about “ill-
ness” per se prior to adolescence. The parents’ response to the sy mptom is important, as
this may determine the level of associated dist ress. It is the parent who may determine the
interpretation of symptoms and the associated time off school and medical help seeking. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. The personality trait of negative affe ctivity (neuroticism ) has been identi-
fied as an independent correlate/risk factor of a high number of somatic symptoms. Comorbid
anxiety or depression is common and ma y exacerbate symptoms and impairment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,358
"Environmental. Somatic symptom disorder is more freq uent in individuals with few years
of education and low socioeconomic status, an d in those who have recently experienced
stressful life events. 
Course modifiers. Persistent somatic symptoms are associated with demographic fea-
tures (female sex, older age, fewer years of education, lo wer socioeconomic status, un-
employment), a reported history of sexual ab use or other childhood adversity, concurrent
chronic physical illness or psychiatric disorder (depression, anxiety, persistent depressive
disorder [dysthymia], panic), social stress, and reinforcing social factors such as illness
benefits. Cognitive factors that affect clinical course include sensitization to pain, height-
ened attention to bodily sen sations, and attribution of bod ily symptoms to a possible med-
ical illness rather than recognizing them as a normal phenomenon or psychological stress. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Somatic symptoms are prominent in various “culture-bound syndromes.” High numbers
of somatic symptoms are found in population -based and primary care studies around the
world, with a similar pattern of the most commonly reported soma tic symptoms, impair-
ment, and treatment seeking. The relationship  between number of somatic symptoms and
illness worry is similar in different cultures, and marked illness worry is associated with
impairment and greater treatment seeking across cultures. The relationship between nu-
merous somatic symptoms and depression a ppears to be very similar around the world
and between different cult ures within one country",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,358
"Despite these similarities, th ere are differences in somatic symptoms among cultures
and ethnic groups. The description of somatic symptoms varies with linguistic and other
local cultural factors. These somatic presenta tions have been described as “idioms of dis-
tress” because somatic symptoms may have special meanings and shape patient-clinician
interactions in the particular cultural cont exts. “Burnout,” the sensation of heaviness or
the complaints of “gas”; too much heat in the body; or burning in the head are examples of
symptoms that are common in some cultures or ethnic groups but rare in others. Explan-
atory models also vary, and somatic symptoms may be attributed variously to particular
family, work, or environmental stresses; general medical illness; the suppression of feel-
ings of anger and resentment; or certain culture-specific ph enomena, such as semen loss",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,358
"There may also be differences in medical trea tment seeking among cultural groups, in ad-
dition to differences due to variable access to medical care services. Seeking treatment for
multiple somatic symptoms in general medical clinics is a worldwide phenomenon and
occurs at similar rates among ethnic groups in the same country",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,358

"314 Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders
Differential Diagnosis
If the somatic symptoms are consistent with an other mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder),
and the diagnostic criteria for that disorder are fulfilled, then that mental disorder should
be considered as an alternative or additional diagnosis. A separate diagnosis of somatic
symptom disorder is not made if the somatic symptoms and related thoughts, feelings, or
behaviors occur only during major depressive episodes. If, as commonly occurs, the crite-
ria for both somatic symptom disorder and another mental disorder diagnosis are ful-
filled, then both should be coded, as both may require treatment. 
Other medical conditions. The presence of somatic symptoms of unclear etiology is not
in itself sufficient to make the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder. The symptoms of
many individuals with disorders like irritabl e bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia would not
satisfy the criterion necessary to diagnose somatic symptom disorder (Criterion B). Con-
versely, the presence of somatic symptoms of an established medical disorder (e.g., diabe-
tes or heart disease) does not exclude the di agnosis of somatic symptom disorder if the
criteria are otherwise met",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,359

disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,359
"Depressive disorders. Depressive disorders are comm only accompanied by somatic
symptoms. However, depressive disorders ar e differentiated from somatic symptom dis-

der, the presenting symptom is loss of function  (e.g., of a limb), whereas in somatic symp-

"Diagnostic Features
Most individuals with hypochondriasis are now classified as having somatic symptom
disorder; however, in a minority of cases, th e diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder applies
instead. Illness anxiety disorder entails a pr eoccupation with having or acquiring a seri-
ous, undiagnosed medical illness (Criterion A) . Somatic symptoms are not present or, if
present, are only mild in intensity (Criterion B). A thorough evaluation fails to identify a
serious medical condition that accounts for the individual’s concer ns. While the concern
may be derived from a nonpathological physica l sign or sensation, the individual’s dis-
tress emanates not primar ily from the physical complaint it self but rather from his or her
anxiety about the meaning, significance, or ca use of the complaint (i.e., the suspected med-
ical diagnosis). If a physical sign or symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological
sensation (e.g., orthostatic dizziness), a benign  and self-limited dysf unction (e.g., transient
tinnitus), or a bodily discomfo rt not generally considered indicative of disease (e.g., belch-
ing). If a diagnosable medical condition is present, the individual’s anxiety and preoccu-
pation are clearly excessive and disproportionate  to the severity of the condition (Criterion
B). Empirical evidence and existing literatur e pertain to previously defined DSM hypo-
chondriasis, and it is unclear to what extent and how precisely they apply to the descrip-
tion of this new diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,360
"The preoccupation with the idea that one is  sick is accompanied by substantial anxiety
about health and disease (Criterion C). Indivi duals with illness anxiety disorder are easily",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,360

alarmed about illness, such as by hearing abou t someone else falling ill or reading a health-
related news story. Their concerns about undiagnosed disease do not respond to appro-
priate medical reassurance, negative diagnostic  tests, or benign course. The physician’s at-
tempts at reassurance and symptom palliation generally do not alleviate the individual’s
concerns and may heighten them . Illness concerns assume a prominent place in the indi-
vidual’s life, affecting daily activities, and may even result in inva lidism. Illness becomes
a central feature of the individual’s identity and self-image, a frequent topic of social dis-
course, and a characteristic response to stressful life events. Individuals with the disorder
often examine themselves repeatedly (e.g., ex amining one’s throat in the mirror) (Crite-
rion D). They research their suspected disease excessively (e.g., on the Internet) and re-
peatedly seek reassurance from family, friends, or physicians. This incessant worrying often
becomes frustrating for others and may result in considerable strain within the family. In
some cases, the anxiety leads to maladaptive avoidance of situations (e.g., visiting sick
family members) or activities (e.g., exercise ) that these individuals fear might jeopardize
their health",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,361
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Because they believe they are medically ill, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are
encountered far more frequently in medical than  in mental health settings. The majority of
individuals with illness anxiety disorder have  extensive yet unsatisfactory medical care,
though some may be too anxious to seek medi cal attention. They generally have elevated
rates of medical utilization but do not utilize me ntal health services more than the general
population. They often consult multiple physi cians for the same problem and obtain re-
peatedly negative diagnostic te st results. At times, medical attention leads to a paradoxical
exacerbation of anxiety or to iatrogenic complications from diagnostic tests and proce-
dures. Individuals with the disorder are genera lly dissatisfied with their medical care and
find it unhelpful, often feelin g they are not being taken seriously by physicians. At times,
these concerns may be justif ied, since physicians sometimes are dismissive or respond
with frustration or hostility. Th is response can occasionally result in a failure to diagnose
a medical condition that is present",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,361
"Prevalence
Prevalence estimates of illness anxiety disorder  are based on estimates of the DSM-III and
DSM-IV diagnosis hypochondriasis.  The 1- to 2-year prevalen ce of health anxiety and/or
disease conviction in community surveys and population-based samp les ranges from 1.3%
to 10%. In ambulatory medica l populations, the 6-month/1-ye ar prevalence rates are be-
tween 3% and 8%. The prevalence of the disorder is similar in  males and females",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,361
"Development and Course 
The development and course of illness anxiety disorder are unclear. Illness anxiety disor-
der is generally thought to be a chronic and relapsing condition with an age at onset in
early and middle adulthood. In population-b ased samples, health -related anxiety in-
creases with age, but the ages of individuals with high health anxi ety in medical settings
do not appear to differ from those of other patients in those settings. In older individuals,
health-related anxiety often focuses on memory loss; the disorder is thought to be rare in
children",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,361
"Risk and Prognostic Factors

Course modifiers. Approximately one-third to one-half of individuals with illness anx-
iety disorder have a transient form, which is associated with less psychiatric comorbidity,
more medical comorbidity, and less severe illness anxiety disorder. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
The diagnosis should be made with caution in  individuals whose ideas about disease are
congruent with widely held, culturally sanctioned beliefs. Little is known about the phe-
nomenology of the disorder acro ss cultures, although the prevalence appears to be similar
across different countries with diverse cultures",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,362
"Functional Consequences of  Illness Anxiety Disorder
Illness anxiety disorder causes substantial role impairment and decrements in physical
function and health-related quality of life. He alth concerns often interfere with interper-
sonal relationships, disrupt family life,  and damage occupational performance. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other medical conditions. The first differential diagnostic  consideration is an underly-
ing medical condition, includin g neurological or endocrine conditions, occult malignan-
cies, and other diseases that affect multiple  body systems. The presence of a medical
condition does not rule out the possibility of coexisting illness anxiety disorder. If a med-
ical condition is present, the health-related  anxiety and disease concerns are clearly dis-
proportionate to its seriousnes s. Transient preoccupations related to a medical condition
do not constitute illn ess anxiety disorder. 
Adjustment disorders. Health-related anxiety is a norm al response to serious illness
and is not a mental disorder. Such nonpathologic al health anxiety is clearly related to the
medical condition and is typica lly time-limited. If the health anxiety is severe enough, an
adjustment disorder may be diagnosed. Howeve r, only when the health anxiety is of suf-
ficient duration, severity, and distress can illnes s anxiety disorder be diagnosed. Thus, the
diagnosis requires the continuous  persistence of disproportio nate health-related anxiety
for at least 6 months. 
Somatic symptom disorder. Somatic symptom disorder is diagnosed when significant
somatic symptoms are present. In contrast, individuals with illness anxiety disorder have
minimal somatic symptoms and are primarily concerned with the idea they are ill. 
Anxiety disorders. In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals worry about multiple
events, situations, or activiti es, only one of which may invol ve health. In panic disorder,
the individual may be concerned that the pani c attacks reflect the presence of a medical ill-
ness; however, although these individuals may have health an xiety, their anxiety is typi-
cally very acute and episodic. In illness anxi ety disorder, the health anxiety and fears are
more persistent and enduring. Individuals wi th illness anxiety disorder may experience
panic attacks that are triggere d by their illness concerns. 
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Individuals with illness anxiety disor-
der may have intrusive though ts about having a disease and also may have associated
compulsive behaviors (e.g., seeking reassurance) . However, in illness anxiety disorder, the
preoccupations are usually focused on having  a disease, whereas in  obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD), the thoughts are intrusive an d are usually focused on fears of getting a
disease in the future. Most individuals with OCD have obsessions or compulsions involv-
ing other concerns in addition  to fears about contracting disease. In body dysmorphic dis-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,362

order, concerns are limited to the individual’s physical appearance, which is viewed as
defective or flawed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,363
"Major depressive disorder. Some individuals with a major depressive episode rumi-
nate about their health and worry excessively about illness. A separate diagnosis of illness
anxiety disorder is not made if these concer ns occur only during major depressive epi-
sodes. However, if excessive illness worry persists after remi ssion of an episode of major
depressive disorder, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder should be considered. 
Psychotic disorders. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are not delusional and
can acknowledge the possibility that the feared disease is no t present. Their ideas do not
attain the rigidity and intens ity seen in the somatic delusions occurring in psychotic dis-
orders (e.g., schizophrenia; delusional disord er, somatic type; major depressive disorder,
with psychotic features). True  somatic delusions are generall y more bizarre (e.g., that an
organ is rotting or dead) than  the concerns seen in illness  anxiety disorder. The concerns
seen in illness anxiety disorder, though not founded in reality, are plausible. 
Comorbidity
Because illness anxiety disorder is a new di sorder, exact co morbidities are unknown. Hy-
pochondriasis co-occurs with anxiety disorders (in particular, generalized anxiety disor-
der, panic disorder, and OCD)  and depressive disorders. Approximately two-thirds of
individuals with illness anxiety disorder are lik ely to have at least one other comorbid ma-
jor mental disorder. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may have an elevated risk
for somatic symptom disorder  and personality disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,363

Diagnostic Features
Many clinicians use the alternative names of “functional” (referring to abnormal central
nervous system functioning) or “psychogenic” (referring to an assumed etiology) to de-
scribe the symptoms of conversion disord er (functional neurol ogical symptom disor-
der). In conversion disorder, there may be on e or more symptoms of various types. Motor
symptoms include weakness or paralysis; abno rmal movements, such as tremor or dys-
tonic movements; gait abnormalities; and abnormal limb posturing. Sensory symptoms
include altered, reduced, or absent skin sens ation, vision, or hearing. Episodes of abnor-
mal generalized limb shaking with apparent im paired or loss of consciousness may resem-
ble epileptic seizures (also called psychogenic or non-epileptic seizures ). There may be
episodes of unresponsiveness  resembling syncope or coma. Other symptoms include re-
duced or absent speech volume (dysphonia/apho nia), altered articulation (dysarthria), a
sensation of a lump in the th roat (globus), and diplopia. 
Although the diagnosis requires that the symptom is not explained by neurological
disease, it should not be ma de simply because results from investigations are normal or
because the symptom is “bizarre.” There must be clinical findings that show clear evidence
of incompatibility with neurological disease. Internal inconsistency at examination is one
way to demonstrate incompatibility (i.e., demonstrating that physical signs elicited
through one examination method are no longer  positive when tested a different way). Ex-
amples of such examination findings include
• Hoover’s sign, in which weakness of hip exte nsion returns to normal strength with con-
tralateral hip flexio n against resistance",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,364
"• Marked weakness of ankle plantar-flexion when  tested on the bed in an individual who
is able to walk on tiptoes;
• Positive findings on the tremor entrainmen t test. On this test, a unilateral tremor may
be identified as functional if the tremor ch anges when the individual is distracted away
from it. This may be observed if the individual is asked to copy the examiner in making
a rhythmical movement with their unaffected hand and this causes the functional
tremor to change such that it copies or “entrains” to the rhythm of the unaffected hand
or the functional tremor is suppressed, or no longer makes a simple rhythmical move-
ment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,364

occurrence of closed eyes with resistance to  opening or a normal simultaneous electro-
encephalogram (although this alone does not exclude all forms of epilepsy or syncope)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,364

"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
A number of associated featur es can support the diagnosis of  conversion disorder. There
may be a history of multiple similar somatic symptoms. Onset may be associated with
stress or trauma, either psychological or physi cal in nature. The potential etiological rele-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,364

while assessment for stress and trauma is im portant, the diagnosis should not be withheld
if none is found",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,365

alization, derealization, and dissociative amne sia, particularly at symptom onset or during
attacks",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,365
"The diagnosis of conversion disorder does not require the judgment that the symptoms
are not intentionally produced (i.e., not feigne d), as the definite ab sence of feigning may
not be reliably discerned. The phenomenon of la belle indifférence  (i.e., lack of concern about
the nature or implications of the symptom)  has been associated wi th conversion disorder
but it is not specific for conver sion disorder and should not be  used to make the diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,365
"Similarly the concept of secondary gain  (i.e., when individuals derive external benefits such
as money or release from respon sibilities) is also not specific to conversion disorder and
particularly in the context of definite evid ence for feigning, the diagnoses that should be
considered instead would include factitious disorder or malingering (see the section “Dif-
ferential Diagnosis” for this disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,365
"Prevalence
Transient conversion symptoms are common, but the precise prevalence of the disorder is
unknown. This is partly because the diagnosis usually requires assessment in secondary
care, where it is found in approximately 5% of referrals to neurology clinics. The incidence
of individual persistent conversion sympto ms is estimated to be 2–5/100,000 per year",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,365

"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Changes resembling conversion (and dissoci ative) symptoms are common in certain

"However the diagnosis of conversion disorder may be made in the presence of another
mental disorder. 
Neurological disease. The main differential diagnosis is neurological disease that might

sessment may be required if the symptoms appe ar to be progressive. Conversion disorder
may coexist with neurological disease",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,366
"Somatic symptom disorder. Conversion disorder may be diagnosed in addition to so-
matic symptom disorder. Most of the somati c symptoms encountered in somatic symptom
disorder cannot be demonstrated to be clea rly incompatible with pathophysiology (e.g.,
pain, fatigue), whereas in conversion disorder , such incompatibility is required for the di-
agnosis. The excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors characterizing somatic symptom

feigning (e.g., clear evidence that loss of fu nction is present during the examination but not

is to assume the sick role or malingering if the aim is to obtain an incentive such as money",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,366
"Dissociative disorders. Dissociative symptoms are co mmon in individuals with con-
version disorder. If both conversion disorder and a dissociati ve disorder are present, both
diagnoses should be made. 
Body dysmorphic disorder. Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are exces-
sively concerned about a perceived defect in th eir physical features bu t do not complain of
symptoms of sensory or motor functi oning in the affected body part. 
Depressive disorders. In depressive disorders, individuals may report general heavi-

symptoms. 
Panic disorder. Episodic neurological symptoms (e.g., tremors and paresthesias) can
occur in both conversion disorder and panic attacks. In panic attacks, the neurological
symptoms are typically transient and acutely episodic with characteristic cardiorespira-
tory symptoms. Loss of awareness with amne sia for the attack and violent limb move-
ments occur in non-epileptic atta cks, but not in panic attacks.

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of  psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is the
presence of one or more clinically significant  psychological or behavi oral factors that ad-
versely affect a medical condition by increasi ng the risk for suffering, death, or disability
(Criterion B). These factors can adversely affe ct the medical condition by influencing its
course or treatment, by constituting an additi onal well-established health risk factor, or by
influencing the underlying pathophysiology to  precipitate or exac erbate symptoms or to
necessitate medical attention. 
Psychological or behavioral factors include ps ychological distress, patterns of interper-
sonal interaction, coping styles, and maladaptiv e health behaviors, such as denial of symp-
toms or poor adherence to medical reco mmendations. Common clin ical examples are
anxiety-exacerbating asthma, denial of need for treatment for acute chest pain, and manip-
ulation of insulin by an individual with diab etes wishing to lose weight. Many different
psychological factors have been demonstrated  to adversely influence medical conditions—
for example, symptoms of depression or anxi ety, stressful life events, relationship style,
personality traits, and coping styles. The adverse effects can range from acute, with imme-
diate medical consequences (e.g., Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) to chronic, occurring over a
long period of time (e.g., chronic occupational  stress increasing risk for hypertension). Af-
fected medical conditions can be those with clear pathophysiology (e.g., diabetes, cancer,
coronary disease), functional syndromes (e.g ., migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, fibro-
myalgia), or idiopathic medical sympto ms (e.g., pain, fatigue, dizziness). ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,367

properly coded as an adjustme nt disorder (a clinically significant psychological response

titudes toward pain and death. Psychologica l factors affecting other medical conditions
must be differentiated from culturally specific  behaviors such as using faith or spiritual
healers or other variations in illness manageme nt that are acceptable within a culture and
represent an attempt to help the medical condition rather than interfere with it. These local
practices may complement rather than obstruct  evidence-based interventions. If they do

vidual with angina that is precipitated when ever he becomes enraged would be diagnosed
as having psychological factors affecting ot her medical conditions, whereas an individual
with angina who developed maladaptive anticipatory anxiety would be diagnosed as hav-
ing an adjustment disorder with anxiety. In clinical practice, however, psychological fac-
tors and a medical condition are often mutua lly exacerbating (e.g., anxiety as both a
precipitant and a consequence of angina), in which case the distinction is arbitrary. Other
mental disorders frequently result in medica l complications, most notably substance use
disorders (e.g., alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder). If an indi vidual has a coexisting

ses of the mental disorder and the medical co ndition are usually sufficient. Psychological

Recording Procedures
When an individual falsifies illness in another (e .g., children, adults, pets), the diagnosis is
factitious disorder imposed on another. The pe rpetrator, not the victim, is given the diag-
nosis. The victim may be given an abuse di agnosis (e.g., 995.54 [T74.12X]; see the chapter
“Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention”). 
Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of factitious disorder is th e falsification of medical or psychological signs
and symptoms in oneself or others that are as sociated with the identified deception. Indi-
viduals with factitious disorder can also seek  treatment for themselves  or another following
induction of injury or disease. The diagnosis requires demonstrating that the individual is
taking surreptitious actions to misrepresent, simulate, or ca use signs or symptoms of ill-
ness or injury in the absence of obvious exte rnal rewards. Methods of illness falsification
can include exaggeration, fabrication, simula tion, and induction. While a preexisting med-
ical condition may be present,  the deceptive behavior or induction of injury associated
with deception causes others to view such in dividuals (or another) as more ill or impaired,
and this can lead to excessive clinical intervention. Individuals with factitious disorder
might, for example, report feelings of depres sion and suicidality following the death of a
spouse despite the death not being true or the individual’s not ha ving a spouse; decep-
tively report episodes of neurological symptoms  (e.g., seizures, dizzine ss, or blacking out);
manipulate a laboratory test (e .g., by adding blood to urine) to falsely indicate an abnor-
mality; falsify medical records to indicate an  illness; ingest a substance (e.g., insulin or
warfarin) to induce an abnormal laboratory result or illness; or physically injure them-
selves or induce illness in themselves or anot her (e.g., by injecting fecal material to produce
an abscess or to induce sepsis)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,370
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with factitious disorder imposed on  self or factitious disorder imposed on an-
other are at risk for experiencing great psyc hological distress or functional impairment by
causing harm to themselves and others. Family , friends, and health care professionals are
also often adversely affected by their behavi or. Factitious disorders have similarities to
substance use disorders, eating disorders, im pulse-control disorders,  pedophilic disorder,
and some other established disorders related to  both the persistence of the behavior and
the intentional efforts to conceal the disord ered behavior through deception. Whereas
some aspects of factitious disorders might represent criminal behavior (e.g., factitious dis-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,370

order imposed on another, in  which the parent’s actions represent abuse and maltreat-
ment of a child), such criminal  behavior and mental illness are not mutually exclusive. The
diagnosis of factitious disorder emphasizes the objective identification of falsification of
signs and symptoms of illness, rather than an inference abou t intent or possible underly-
ing motivation. Moreover, such behaviors, incl uding the induction of injury or disease, are
associated with deception. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of factitious disorder is unknow n, likely because of the role of deception in
this population. Among patients in hospital sett ings, it is estimated that about 1% of indi-
viduals have presentations that meet the criteria for factitious disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,371
"Development and Course
The course of factitious disorder is usually one of intermittent episodes. Single episodes
and episodes that are characterized as pers istent and unremitting are both less common",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,371
"Onset is usually in early adulthood, often after hospitalization for a medical condition or a
mental disorder. When imposed on another, the disorder may begin after hospitalization
of the individual’s child or other dependent. In individuals with recu rrent episodes of fal-
sification of signs and symptoms of illness and/ or induction of injury, this pattern of suc-
cessive deceptive contact with medical personnel, including hospitalizations, may become
lifelong. 
Differential Diagnosis
Caregivers who lie about abuse injuries in depe ndents solely to protect themselves from lia-
bility are not diagnosed with factitious disord er imposed on another because protection from
liability is an external reward (Criterion C, th e deceptive behavior is evident even in the ab-
sence of obvious external rewards). Such caregi vers who, upon observation, analysis of med-
ical records, and/or interviews with others, are found to lie more extensively than needed for
immediate self-protect ion are diagnosed with factitious disorder imposed on another",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,371
"Somatic symptom disorder. In somatic symptom disorder, there may be excessive at-
tention and treatment seeking for perceived medical concerns, but there is no evidence that
the individual is providing false info rmation or behaving deceptively. 
Malingering. Malingering is differentiated from fact itious disorder by the intentional re-
porting of symptoms for personal gain (e.g., money, time off work). In contrast, the diag-
nosis of factitious disorder requires  the absence of obvious rewards. 
Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). Conversion disorder
is characterized by neurological symptoms that  are inconsistent with neurological patho-
physiology. Factitious disorder with neurological symptoms is distinguished from con-
version disorder by evidence of de ceptive falsification of symptoms. 
Borderline personality disorder. Deliberate physical self-harm in the absence of suicidal
intent can also occur in association with other mental disorders su ch as borderline person-
ality disorder. Factitious disord er requires that the induction of injury occur in association
with deception. 
Medical condition or mental disorder not associated with intentional symptom falsifi-
cation. Presentation of signs and sy mptoms of illness that do not conform to an identi-
fiable medical condition or mental disorder increases the likelihood of the presence of a
factitious disorder. However, the diagnosis of factitious disorder does not exclude the
presence of true medical cond ition or mental disorder, as comorbid illness often occurs in
the individual along with factitious disord er. For example, individuals who might manip-
ulate blood sugar levels to produce symptoms may also have diabetes.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,371

"329Feeding and
Eating Disorders
Feeding and eating  disorders are characterized by a persistent disturbance of eat-
ing or eating-related behavior that results in the altered consumption or absorption of
food and that significantly impairs physical he alth or psychosocial functioning. Diagnos-
tic criteria are provid ed for pica, rumination disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake
disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. 
The diagnostic criteria for rumination diso rder, avoidant/restrictive food intake dis-
order, anorexia nervosa,  bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating  disorder result in a classifica-
tion scheme that is mutually ex clusive, so that during a sing le episode, only one of these
diagnoses can be assigned. The rationale for this approach is that, despite a number of

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of pica is the eating of on e or more nonnutritive, nonfood substances on a
persistent basis over a period of at least 1 month (Criterion A) that is severe enough to warrant
clinical attention. Typical substances ingested te nd to vary with age and availability and might
include paper, soap, cloth, hair , string, wool, soil, chalk, talc um powder, paint, gum, metal,
pebbles, charcoal or coal, ash, clay, starch, or ice. The term nonfood  is included because the di-
agnosis of pica does not apply to ingestion of diet products that have minimal nutritional con-
tent. There is typically no aversion to food in general. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood
substances must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B)  and not part of a culturally
supported or socially normativ e practice (Criterion C). A minimum age of 2 years is suggested
for a pica diagnosis to exclude developmentally normal mouthing of objects by infants that re-
sults in ingestion. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances can be an associated feature
of other mental disorders (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder],
autism spectrum disorder, schizo phrenia). If the eating behavior occurs exclusively in the con-
text of another mental disorder, a separate diagnosis of pica should be made only if the eating
behavior is sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention (Criterion D)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,375
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Although deficiencies in vitamins or minerals (e .g., zinc, iron) have been reported in some
instances, often no specific biological abnorm alities are found. In some cases, pica comes
to clinical attention only following general medical complications (e.g., mechanical bowel
problems; intestinal obstruction,  such as that resulting from  a bezoar; intestinal perfora-
tion; infections such as toxoplasmosis and toxoca riasis as a result of ingesting feces or dirt;

"Development and Course
Onset of pica can occur in childhood, adolesce nce, or adulthood, although childhood onset
is most commonly reported. Pi ca can occur in otherwise normally developing children,
whereas in adults, it appears more likely to o ccur in the context of intellectual disability or
other mental disorders. The ea ting of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may also manifest
in pregnancy, when specific cravings (e.g., chalk or ice) might occur. The diagnosis of pica
during pregnancy is only appropriate if such  cravings lead to the ingestion of nonnutri-
tive, nonfood substances to the extent that th e eating of these substances poses potential
medical risks. The course of th e disorder can be protracted an d can result in medical emer-
gencies (e.g., intestinal obstruction, acute weight loss, poisoning). The disorder can poten-
tially be fatal depending on substances ingested",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,375

such cases, when the eating of nonnutritive,  nonfood substances is primarily used as a
means of weight control, anorexia ne rvosa should be the primary diagnosis. 
Factitious disorder. Some individuals with factitious disorder may intentionally ingest
foreign objects as part of the pattern of fals ification of physical symptoms. In such in-

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of rumina tion disorder is the repeated regurgitation of food occur-
ring after feeding or eating over a period of at least 1 month (Criterion A). Previously swal-
lowed food that may be partially digested is brought up into the mouth without apparent
nausea, involuntary retching, or disgust. The food may be re-chewed and then ejected
from the mouth or re-swallow ed. Regurgitation in ruminati on disorder should be fre-
quent, occurring at least several times per we ek, typically daily. The behavior is not better
explained by an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e.g., gastroesoph-
ageal reflux, pyloric stenosis) (Criterion B) and does not occur exclusively during the
course of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restric-
tive food intake disorder (Criterion C). If the symptoms occur in the context of another
mental disorder (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmen tal disorder], neuro-
developmental disorder), they must be suffici ently severe to warrant additional clinical
attention (Criterion D) and should represent a primary aspect of the individual’s presen-
tation requiring intervention. The disorder may be diagnosed across the life span, par-
ticularly in individuals who also have in tellectual disability. Many individuals with
rumination disorder can be dire ctly observed engaging in the behavior by the clinician. In
other instances diagnosis can be made on the basis of self-report or  corroborative informa-

weight gains are common features in infants with rumination disorder. Malnutrition may
occur despite the infant’s appa rent hunger and the ingestion of relatively large amounts of

ously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained period of time",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,379
"Diagnostic Features
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces and extends the DSM-IV diagnosis of
feeding disorder of infancy or  early childhood. The main diagnostic feature of avoidant/
restrictive food intake disorder is avoidance or restriction of food intake (Criterion A)
manifested by clinically significant failure to  meet requirements for nutrition or insuffi-
cient energy intake through oral intake of food. One or more of the following key features
must be present: significant weight loss, si gnificant nutritional deficiency (or related
health impact), dependence on enteral feedin g or oral nutritional supplements, or marked
interference with psychosocial functioning.  The determination of whether weight loss is
significant (Criterion A1) is a clinical judgme nt; instead of losing weight, children and ad-
olescents who have not completed growth may not maintain weight or height increases
along their developmental trajectory",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,379
"Determination of significant nu tritional deficiency (Criterion A2) is also based on clin-
ical assessment (e.g., assessment of dietary intake, physical examination, and laboratory
testing), and related impact on physical health can be of a similar seve rity to that seen in
anorexia nervosa (e.g., hypother mia, bradycardia, anemia). In severe cases, particularly in
infants, malnutrition can be life threatening.  “Dependence” on enteral feeding or oral nu-
tritional supplements (Criterion A3) means that  supplementary feeding is required to sus-
tain adequate intake. Examples of individu als requiring supplementary feeding include
infants with failure to thrive who require na sogastric tube feeding, children with neuro-
developmental disorders who are dependent on  nutritionally complete supplements, and
individuals who rely on gastrostomy tube feeding or complete oral nutrition supplements

activities, such as eating with others, or to sustain relationsh ips as a result of the distur-
bance would indicate marked interference wi th psychosocial functioning (Criterion A4)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,380
"Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder does not include avoidance or restriction of
food intake related to lack of availability of food or to cultural practices (e.g., religious fast-
ing or normal dieting) (Criterion B), nor does it include developmentally normal behaviors
(e.g., picky eating in toddlers, reduced intake in older adults). The disturbance is not better
explained by excessive concern about body weight  or shape (Criterion C) or by concurrent
medical factors or mental disorders (Criterion D). 
In some individuals, food av oidance or restriction may be based on the sensory char-
acteristics of qualities of fo od, such as extreme sensitivity to appearance, color, smell,
texture, temperature, or taste. Such behavior  has been described as  “restrictive eating,”
“selective eating,” “choosy eating,” “perseverant eating,” “chronic food refusal,” and
“food neophobia” and may manifest as refusal to  eat particular brands of foods or to tol-
erate the smell of food being eaten by others . Individuals with heightened sensory sensi-
tivities associated with autism  may show similar behaviors. 
Food avoidance or restriction may also repr esent a conditioned negative response as-
sociated with food intake following, or in an ticipation of, an aversive experience, such as
choking; a traumatic investigation, usually invo lving the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., esoph-
agoscopy); or repeated vomiting. The terms functional dysphagia and globus hystericus  have
also been used for such conditions. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
Several features may be associated with food avoidance or reduced food intake, including
a lack of interest in eating or food, leading to weight loss or faltering growth. Very young
infants may present as being too sleepy, distre ssed, or agitated to feed. Infants and young
children may not engage with the primary ca regiver during feeding or communicate hun-
ger in favor of other activities. In older child ren and adolescents, food  avoidance or restric-
tion may be associated with more generali zed emotional difficulties that do not meet
diagnostic criteria for an an xiety, depressive, or bipolar disorder, sometimes called “food
avoidance emotional disorder.” 
Development and Course
Food avoidance or restriction associated with in sufficient intake or lack of interest in eat-
ing most commonly develops in infancy or early childhood and may persist in adulthood",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,380
"Likewise, avoidance based on sensory characterist ics of food tends to arise in the first de-
cade of life but may persist into adulthood. Avoidance related to aversive consequences
can arise at any age. The scant literature re garding long-term outcomes suggests that food
avoidance or restriction based on sensory aspects is relatively stable and long-standing,
but when persisting into adulthood, such avoidance/restriction can be associated with rel-
atively normal functioning. There is currently insufficient evidence directly linking avoid-
ant/restrictive food intake disorder and subsequent onset of an eating disorder. 
Infants with avoidant/restrictive food intake  disorder may be irritable and difficult to
console during feeding, or ma y appear apathetic and withdrawn. In some instances, par-
ent-child interaction may contri bute to the infant’s feeding problem (e.g., presenting food
inappropriately, or interpreting the infant’s be havior as an act of aggression or rejection)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,380
"Inadequate nutritional intake may exacerbate the associated fe atures (e.g., irritability, de-
velopmental lags) and further contribute to f eeding difficulties. Associated factors include
infant temperament or developm ental impairments that reduce  an infant’s responsiveness
to feeding. Coexisting parental psychopathology, or child abus e or neglect, is suggested if
feeding and weight improve in response to ch anging caregivers. In infants, children, and
prepubertal adolescents, avoidant/restrictive food intake di sorder may be associated with

fear of being observed by others while eating , which can also occur in avoidant/restrictive
food intake disorder. 
Anorexia nervosa. Restriction of energy intake relati ve to requirements  leading to sig-
nificantly low body weight is a core featur e of anorexia nervosa.  However, individuals
with anorexia nervosa also display a fear of ga ining weight or of becoming fat, or persis-
tent behavior that interferes with weight gain , as well as specific disturbances in relation to
perception and experience of their own body weight and shape. These features are not
present in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and the two disorders should not be

disorder and anorexia nervosa may be difficult,  especially in late childhood and early ad-
olescence, because these disorders may share a number of common symptoms (e.g., food
avoidance, low weight). Differential diagnosis is also potentially difficult in individuals
with anorex ia nervosa who deny any fear of fatness but nonetheless engage in persistent
behaviors that prevent weight gain and who do not recognize the medical seriousness of
their low weight—a presentation sometimes termed “non-fat phobic anorexia nervosa.”

"Diagnostic Features
There are three essential features of anorexia  nervosa: persistent en ergy intake restriction;
intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming  fat, or persistent behavior that interferes
with weight gain; and a disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape. The individual main-
tains a body weight that is below a minimally normal level for age, sex, developmental tra-
jectory, and physical health (Criterion A). In dividuals’ body weights frequently meet this
criterion following a significant weight loss, but among children and adolescents, there
may alternatively be failure to make expected weight gain or to maintain a normal devel-
opmental trajectory (i.e., while grow ing in height) instead of weight loss.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,384
"340 Feeding and Eating Disorders
Criterion A requires that the individual’s weight be significantly low (i.e., less than
minimally normal or, for children and adoles cents, less than that minimally expected)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,385
"Weight assessment can be challenging because normal weight range differs among indi-
viduals, and different thresholds have been published defining thinness or underweight
status. Body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms/height in meters2) is a
useful measure to assess body weight for height. For adults, a BMI of 18.5 kg/m2 has been
employed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) as the lower limit of normal body we ight. Therefore, most adults with
a BMI greater than or  equal to 18.5 kg/m2 would not be considered to have a significantly
low body weight. On the other ha nd, a BMI of lower than 17.0 kg/m2 has been considered
by the WHO to indicate moderate or severe thinness; therefore, an individual with a BMI
less than 17.0 kg/m2 would likely be considered to have a significantly low weight. An
adult with a BMI between  17.0 and 18.5 kg/m2, or even above 18.5 kg/m2, might be consid-
ered to have a significantly low weight if clinical history or other physiological informa-
tion supports this judgment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,385
"For children and adolescents, de termining a BMI-for-age percentile is useful (see, e.g.,
the CDC BMI percentile calculator for children and teenagers. As for adults, it is not pos-
sible to provide definitive standards for judgin g whether a child’s or an adolescent’s weight
is significantly low, and variations in deve lopmental trajectories among youth limit the
utility of simple numerical guidelines. The CD C has used a BMI-for-age below the 5th per-
centile as suggesting underweight; however,  children and adolesce nts with a BMI above
this benchmark may be judged to be significantly underweight in light of failure to main-
tain their expected growth trajectory. In su mmary, in determining whether Criterion A is
met, the clinician should consider available numerical guidelines, as well as the individual’s
body build, weight history, an d any physiological disturbances",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,385
"Individuals with this disorder typically display an intense fear of gaining weight or of
becoming fat (Criterion B). This intense fear of becoming fat is usually not alleviated by
weight loss. In fact, concern about weight gain  may increase even as weight falls. Younger
individuals with anorexia nervosa, as well as  some adults, may not recognize or acknowl-
edge a fear of weight gain. In the absence of  another explanation for the significantly low
weight, clinician inference drawn from collateral history, observatio nal data, physical and
laboratory findings, or longitudinal course eith er indicating a fear of weight gain or sup-
porting persistent behaviors that prevent it  may be used to es tablish Criterion B. 
The experience and significance of body weight and shape are distorted in these indi-
viduals (Criterion C). Some individuals feel globally overweight. Others realize that they
are thin but are still concerned th at certain body parts, partic ularly the abdomen, buttocks,
and thighs, are “too fat.” They may employ a variety of techniques to evaluate their body
size or weight, including frequent weighing, obsessive measuring of body parts, and per-
sistent use of a mirror to check for perceived areas of “fat.” The self-esteem of individuals
with anorexia nervosa is highly dependent on their perceptions of body shape and weight",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,385
"Weight loss is often viewed as an impressive ac hievement and a sign of extraordinary self-
discipline, whereas weight gain is perceived as an unacceptable failure of self-control. Al-
though some individuals with this disorder  may acknowledge being thin, they often do
not recognize the serious medical implic ations of their malnourished state. 
Often, the individual is brought to professional attention by family members after marked
weight loss (or failure to make expected weight gains) has occurred. If individuals seek help
on their own, it is usually because of dist ress over the somatic and psychological sequelae
of starvation. It is rare for an individual with anorexia nervosa to complain of weight loss
per se. In fact, individuals with anorexia nervos a frequently either lack insight into or deny
the problem. It is therefore often important to obtain information from family members or
other sources to evaluate the history of weight loss and other features of the illness.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,385
"Anorexia Nervosa 341
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
The semi-starvation of anorex ia nervosa, and the purging behaviors sometimes associated
with it, can result in significant and potentially life-threatening medical conditions. The
nutritional compromise associated with this  disorder affects most  major organ systems
and can produce a variety of disturbances. Ph ysiological disturbances, including amenor-
rhea and vital sign abnormalities, are comm on. While most of the physiological distur-
bances associated with malnutrition are reversible with nutritiona l rehabilitation, some,
including loss of bone mineral density, are often not completely re versible. Behaviors such
as self-induced vomiting and misuse of laxa tives, diuretics, and enemas may cause a num-
ber of disturbances that lead to abnormal la boratory findings; howe ver, some individuals
with anorexia nervosa exhibit no laboratory abnormalities. 
When seriously underweight, ma ny individuals with anorex ia nervosa have depressive
signs and symptoms such as depressed mood, so cial withdrawal, irrita bility, insomnia, and
diminished interest in sex. Because these feat ures are also observed in individuals without
anorexia nervosa who are significantly undern ourished, many of the depressive features
may be secondary to the physiological sequelae of semi-starvation, although they may also
be sufficiently severe to warr ant an additional diagnosis of major depressive disorder. 
Obsessive-compulsive features, both related and unrelated to food, are often prominent",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,386
"Most individuals with anorexia nervosa are pr eoccupied with thoughts of food. Some col-
lect recipes or hoard food. Ob servations of behaviors associated with other forms of star-
vation suggest that obsessions and compulsi ons related to food may be exacerbated by
undernutrition. When individuals with anorexia nervosa exhibit obsessions and compul-
sions that are not related to food, body shape, or weight, an additional diagnosis of obses-
sive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be warranted",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,386
"Other features sometimes associated with anorexia nervosa incl ude concerns about
eating in public, feelings of ineffectiveness, a strong desire  to control one’s environment,
inflexible thinking, limited social spontaneity, and overly restrained emotional ex-
pression. Compared with indivi duals with anorexia nervosa, restricting type, those with
binge-eating/purging type have higher rates of impulsivity and are more likely to abuse
alcohol and other drugs. 
A subgroup of individuals with anorexia ne rvosa show excessive levels of physical ac-
tivity. Increases in physical activity often precede onset of the disorder, and over the
course of the disorder increased activity ac celerates weight loss. During treatment, exces-
sive activity may be difficult to control,  thereby jeopardizing weight recovery",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,386
"Individuals with anorexia nervosa may misu se medications, such as by manipulating
dosage, in order to achieve we ight loss or avoid weight ga in. Individuals with diabetes
mellitus may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to minimi ze carbohydrate  metabolism. 
Prevalence
The 12-month prevalence of anorexia nervosa among youn g females is approximately
0.4%. Less is known about prevalence among ma les, but anorexia nerv osa is far less com-
mon in males than in females, with clinical populations generally reflecting approximately
a 10:1 female-to-male ratio. 
Development and Course
Anorexia nervosa commonly begins during adolescence or young adulthood. It rarely be-
gins before puberty or after age 40, but cases of both early and late onset have been de-
scribed. The onset of this disorder is often a ssociated with a stressful life event, such as
leaving home for college. The course and outcom e of anorexia nervosa are highly variable",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,386

include more signs and symptoms of long-stand ing disorder. Clinicians should not exclude
anorexia nervosa from the differential diag nosis solely on the basis of older age",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,387
"Many individuals have a period of changed ea ting behavior prior to full criteria for the
disorder being met. Some individuals with anorexia nervosa recover fully after a single
episode, with some ex hibiting a fluctuating pattern of weight gain followed by relapse,
and others experiencing a chronic course over many years. Hospitalization may be re-
quired to restore weight and to address medical complications. Most individuals with an-
orexia nervosa experience remission within 5 years of presentation. Among individuals
admitted to hospitals, overall remission rates may be lower. The crude mortality rate (CMR)
for anorexia nervosa is approximately 5% pe r decade. Death most commonly results from
medical complications associated with the disorder itself or from suicide",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,387

Temperamental. Individuals who develop anxiety disorders or display obsessional
traits in childhood are at increased risk of developing anorexia nervosa",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,387
"Environmental. Historical and cross-cultural variab ility in the prevalence of anorexia
nervosa supports its association with cultures and settings in which thinness is valued. Oc-
cupations and avocations that encourage thinness, such as modeling and elite athletics, are
also associated with increased risk. 
Genetic and physiological. There is an increased risk of  anorexia nervosa and bulimia
nervosa among first-degree biolog ical relatives of individuals with the disorder. An in-
creased risk of bipolar and depressive diso rders has also been found among first-degree
relatives of individuals with anorexia nervos a, particularly relati ves of individuals with
the binge-eating/purging type. Concordance rates for anorexia nervosa in monozygotic
twins are significantly higher than those for dizygotic twins. A range of brain abnormali-
ties has been described in an orexia nervosa using functional imaging technologies (func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging, positro n emission tomography).  The degree to which
these findings reflect changes associated with  malnutrition versus primary abnormalities
associated with the disorder is unclear",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,387
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Anorexia nervosa occurs across culturally and so cially diverse populations, although available
evidence suggests cross-cultural variation in its occurrence and pres entation. Anorexia ner-
vosa is probably most prevalent in post-industr ialized, high-income coun tries such as in the
United States, many European c ountries, Australia, New Zealand,  and Japan, but its incidence
in most low- and middle-income countries is uncertain. Whereas the prevalence of anorexia
nervosa appears comparatively low among Latino s, African Americans, and Asians in the
United States, clinicians should be aware that mental health service utilization among individ-
uals with an eating disorder is significantly lo wer in these ethnic groups and that the low rates
may reflect an ascertainment bias. The presenta tion of weight concer ns among individuals
with eating and feeding disorders varies substa ntially across cultural contexts. The absence of
an expressed intense fear of we ight gain, sometimes referred to  as “fat phobia,” appears to be
relatively more common in popu lations in Asia, where the rati onale for dietary restriction is
commonly related to a more culturally sanction ed complaint such as gastrointestinal discom-
fort. Within the United States, presentations with out a stated intense fear of weight gain may
be comparatively more common among Latino groups",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,387

"344 Feeding and Eating Disorders
Differential Diagnosis
Other possible causes of either significantly low body weight or significant weight loss
should be considered in the differential diagno sis of anorexia nervosa, especially when the
presenting features are atypical (e.g., onset after age 40 years). 
Medical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, hyperthyroidism, occult malignan-
cies, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]). Serious weight loss may oc-
cur in medical conditions, but individuals with  these disorders usually do not also mani-
fest a disturbance in the way their body weig ht or shape is experienced or an intense fear
of weight gain or persist in behaviors that interfere with appropriate weight gain. Acute
weight loss associated with a medical condition can occasionally be followed by the onset
or recurrence of anorexia nervosa, which can initially be masked by the comorbid medical
condition. Rarely, anorexia nervosa develo ps after bariatric surgery for obesity. 
Major depressive disorder. In major depressive disorder, severe weight loss may occur,
but most individuals with major depressive diso rder do not have either a desire for exces-
sive weight loss or an inte nse fear of gaining weight. 
Schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia may exhibit odd eating behavior and oc-
casionally experience significant weight loss, but they rarely show the fear of gaining
weight and the body image disturbance requir ed for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. 
Substance use disorders. Individuals with subs tance use disorders may experience low
weight due to poor nutritional intake but gene rally do not fear gaining weight and do not
manifest body image di sturbance. Individuals who abuse substances that reduce appetite
(e.g., cocaine, stimulan ts) and who also endorse fear of weight gain should be carefully
evaluated for the possibility of  comorbid anorexia nervosa, given that the substance use
may represent a persistent behavior that inte rferes with weight gain (Criterion B)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,389
"Social anxiety disorder (social phobia), ob sessive-compulsive disorder, and body dys-
morphic disorder. Some of the features of anorexia ne rvosa overlap with the criteria for
social phobia, OCD, and body dysmorphic diso rder. Specifically, individuals may feel hu-
miliated or embarrassed to be seen eating in public, as in social phobia; may exhibit obses-
sions and compulsions related to  food, as in OCD; or may be preoccupied with an imagined
defect in bodily appearance, as in body dysmor phic disorder. If the in dividual with anorexia
nervosa has social fears that are limited to eating behavior alone, the diagnosis of social pho-
bia should not be made, but social fears unrelate d to eating behavior (e.g., excessive fear of
speaking in public) may warrant an additional diagnosis of social phobia. Similarly, an ad-
ditional diagnosis of OCD should be considered only if the individu al exhibits obsessions
and compulsions unrelated to food (e.g., an ex cessive fear of contamination), and an addi-
tional diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder sh ould be considered only if the distortion is

"Diagnostic Features
There are three essential features of bulimia nervosa: recurrent episodes of binge eating
(Criterion A), recurrent inappropriate comp ensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain
(Criterion B), and self-evaluat ion that is unduly influenced by body shape and weight
(Criterion D). To qualify for the diagnosis, the binge eating and inappropriate compensa-
tory behaviors must occur, on average, at least once per week for 3 months (Criterion C)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,390
"An “episode of binge eating” is defined as  eating, in a discrete period of time, an
amount of food that is definitely larger than  most individuals would eat in a similar period
of time under similar circumstances (Criterion  A1). The context in which the eating occurs",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,390
"346 Feeding and Eating Disorders
may affect the clinician’s esti mation of whether the intake is excessive. For example, a
quantity of food that might be regarded as excessive for a typical meal might be consid-
ered normal during a celebration or holiday me al. A “discrete period of time” refers to a
limited period, usually less than  2 hours. A single episode of binge eating need not be re-
stricted to one setting. For example, an individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and
then continue to eat on re turning home. Continual snacki ng on small amounts of food
throughout the day would not be considered an eating binge. 
An occurrence of excessive food consumptio n must be accompanied by a sense of lack
of control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss
of control is the inability to refrain from eating  or to stop eating once started. Some indi-
viduals describe a dissociative quality during , or following, the bing e-eating episodes. The
impairment in control associated with binge eating may not be abso lute; for example, an
individual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a
roommate or spouse unexpected ly enters the room. Some in dividuals report that their
binge-eating episodes are no longer characterize d by an acute feeling of  loss of control but
rather by a more generalized pattern of uncont rolled eating. If individuals report that they
have abandoned efforts to control their eati ng, loss of control should be considered as
present. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,391
"The type of food co nsumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a
given individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the
amount of food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient. However, during binges,
individuals tend to eat foods they would otherwise avoid. 
Individuals with bulimia nervosa are typica lly ashamed of their eating problems and
attempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating  usually occurs in secrecy or as inconspic-
uously as possible. The binge eating often cont inues until the individual is uncomfortably,
or even painfully, full. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative affect",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,391
"Other triggers include interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related
to body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may minimize or mit-
igate factors that precipitated  the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation
and dysphoria often are the delayed consequences",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,391
"Another essential feature of bulimia nervosa is the recurrent use of inappropriate com-
pensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, collectively referred to as purge behaviors or
purging  (Criterion B). Many individuals with bulimia nervosa employ  several methods to
compensate for binge eating. Vomiting is the most common inappropriate compensatory
behavior. The immediate effects of vomiting include relief from physical discomfort and re-
duction of fear of gaining weight. In some cases, vomiting becomes a goal in itself, and the
individual will binge eat in orde r to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of food",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,391
"Individuals with bulimia nervosa may use a vari ety of methods to induce vomiting, includ-
ing the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the gag reflex. Individuals generally
become adept at inducing vomit ing and are eventually able to  vomit at will. Rarely, indi-
viduals consume syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. Other purging behaviors include the
misuse of laxatives and diuretics. A number  of other compensatory methods may also be
used in rare cases. Individuals with bulim ia nervosa may misuse enemas following epi-
sodes of binge eating, but this is seldom th e sole compensatory method employed. Individ-
uals with this disorder may take thyroid ho rmone in an attempt to avoid weight gain",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,391
"Individuals with diabetes mellitus and bulimia nervosa may omit or reduce insulin doses in
order to reduce the metabolism of food cons umed during eating bi nges. Individuals with
bulimia nervosa may fast for a da y or more or exercise excessive ly in an attempt to prevent
weight gain. Exercise may be considered excessi ve when it significantly interferes with im-
portant activities, when it occurs at inappr opria te times or in i nappropriate settings, or

"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with bulimia nervosa typically ar e within the normal weight or overweight
range (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 18.5 and < 30 in adults). The disorder occurs but is un-
common among obese individuals. Between eati ng binges, individuals with bulimia ner-
vosa typically restrict their to tal caloric consumption and preferentially select low-calorie
(“diet”) foods while avoiding foods that they pe rceive to be fattening or likely to trigger a
binge",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,392
"Menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea ofte n occurs among females with bulimia ner-
vosa; it is uncertain whether su ch disturbances are related to weight fluctuations, to nu-
tritional deficiencies, or to emotional dist ress. The fluid and electrolyte disturbances
resulting from the purging behavior are some times sufficiently severe to constitute med-
ically serious problems. Rare but potentially fatal complications include esophageal tears,
gastric rupture, and cardiac arrhythmias. Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have
been reported among individual s following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce vom-
iting. Individuals who chronically abuse laxatives may become dependent on their use to
stimulate bowel movements. Gastrointestin al symptoms are commonly associated with
bulimia nervosa, and rectal prolapse has also  been reported among individuals with this
disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,392
"Prevalence
Twelve-month prevalence of bulimia ner vosa among young female s is 1%–1.5%. Point
prevalence is highest among young adults si nce the disorder peaks in older adolescence
and young adulthood. Less is known about th e point prevalence of bulimia nervosa in
males, but bulimia nervosa is far less common in  males than it is in females, with an ap-
proximately 10:1 female-to-male ratio. 
Development and Course
Bulimia nervosa commonly begins in adolesce nce or young adulthood. Onset before pu-
berty or after age 40 is uncommon. The binge eating frequently begins during or after an
episode of dieting to lose weight. Experiencing  multiple stressful lif e events also can pre-
cipitate onset of bulimia nervosa",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,392
"Disturbed eating behavior persists for at least several years in a high percentage of
clinic samples. The course may be chronic or intermittent, with periods of remission
alternating with recurrences of binge eating. However, over longer -term follow-up, the
symptoms of many individuals appear to diminish with or without treatment, although
treatment clearly impacts outcome. Periods of remission longer than 1 year are associated
with better long-term outcome",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,392

"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Weight concerns, low self-esteem, de pressive symptoms, social anxi-
ety disorder, and overanxious d isorder of childhood are associated with increased risk for
the development of bulimia nervosa. 
Environmental. Internalization of a thin body ideal has been found to increase risk for
developing weight concerns, which in turn increase risk for the development of bulimia
nervosa. Individuals who experienced childhood  sexual or physical abuse are at increased
risk for developing bulimia nervosa. 
Genetic and physiological. Childhood obesity and early pubertal maturation increase
risk for bulimia nervosa. Familial transmission of bulimia ne rvosa may be present, as well
as genetic vulnerabilities for the disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,393

Bulimia nervosa has been reported to occur wi th roughly similar frequencies in most in-
dustrialized countries, including the United  States, Canada, many European countries,
Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Afri ca. In clinical studies of bulimia nervosa in
the United States, individuals presenting with  this disorder are pr imarily white. However,
the disorder also occurs in ot her ethnic groups and with prevalence comparable to esti-
mated prevalences observed in white samples",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,393

"Diagnostic Markers
No specific diagnostic test for bulimia nerv osa currently exists. However, several labora-
tory abnormalities may occur as a conseque nce of purging and may increase diagnostic
certainty. These include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia (which
can provoke cardiac arrhythmias), hypochloremia, and hyponatremia. The loss of gastric
acid through vomiting may prod uce a metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbonate),
and the frequent induction of diarrhea or de hydration through laxative and diuretic abuse
can cause metabolic acidosis. Some individual s with bulimia nervosa exhibit mildly ele-
vated levels of serum amylase, pr obably reflecting an increase in the salivary isoenzyme",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,393
"Physical examination usually yields no physical findings. However, inspection of the
mouth may reveal significant and permanent loss of dental enamel, especially from lin-
gual surfaces of the front teeth due to recurrent vomiting. These teeth may become
chipped and appear ragged and “moth-eaten.” There may also be an increased frequency
of dental caries. In some individuals, the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands,
may become notably enlarged. Individuals who induce vomiting by manually stimulating
the gag reflex may develop calluses or scars on the dorsal surface of the hand from re-
peated contact with the teeth. Serious cardia c and skeletal myopathies have been reported
among individuals following repeated use of  syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,393

Suicide Risk
Suicide risk is elevated in bu limia nervosa. Comprehensive ev aluation of individuals with

"Functional Consequences  of Bulimia Nervosa
Individuals with bulimia nervosa may exhibit a range of functional limitations associated
with the disorder. A minority of individuals report severe role impairment, with the so-
cial-life domain most likely to be ad versely affected by  bulimia nervosa. 
Differential Diagnosis
Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type. Individuals whose bi nge-eating behav-
ior occurs only during episodes of anorexia  nervosa are given the diagnosis anorexia ner-
vosa, binge-eating/purging type, and should  not be given the additional diagnosis of
bulimia nervosa. For individuals with an init ial diagnosis of anorexia nervosa who binge
and purge but whose presentation no longer meets the full criteria for anorexia nervosa,
binge-eating/purging type (e.g., when weight  is normal), a diagnosis of bulimia ner-
vosa should be given only when all criteria for bulimia nervosa have been met for at least
3m o n t h s .  
Binge-eating disorder. Some individuals binge eat but do  not engage in regular inap-
propriate compensatory behaviors. In these ca ses, the diagnosis of binge-eating disorder
should be considered",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,394

Major depressive disorder, with atypical features. Overeating is common in major de-
pressive disorder, with atypical  features, but individuals with this disorder do not engage
in inappropriate compensatory behaviors an d do not exhibit the excessive concern with

met, both diagnoses should be given.

"Comorbidity 
Comorbidity with mental diso rders is common in individuals with bulimia nervosa, with
most experiencing at least on e other mental disorder and many experiencing multiple co-
morbidities. Comorbidity is not limited to any particular su bset but rather occurs across a
wide range of mental disorders. There is an  increased frequency of depressive symptoms
(e.g., low self-esteem) and bipo lar and depressive disorders (particularly depressive dis-
orders) in individuals with bu limia nervosa. In many indivi duals, the mood disturbance
begins at the same time as or following th e development of bulimia nervosa, and individ-

"355Elimination
 Disorders
Elimination disorders  all involve the inappropriate elimination of urine or feces
and are usually first diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. This group of disorders in-
cludes enuresis,  the repeated voiding of urine into inappropriate places, and encopresis, the
repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places. Subtypes are provided to differentiate
nocturnal from diurnal (i.e., during waking hours) voiding for enuresis and the presence or
absence of constipation and ove rflow incontinence for encopresis. Although there are min-
imum age requirements for diagnosis of both disorders, these are based on developmental
age and not solely on chronological age. Both  disorders may be volun tary or involuntary",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,400

"Subtypes
The nocturnal-only subtype of enuresis, sometimes referred to as monosymptomatic enure-
sis, is the most common subtype and involves incontinence only during nighttime sleep,
typically during the fi rst one-third of the night. The di urnal-only subtype occurs in the
absence of nocturnal enuresis and may be referred to simply as urinary incontinence.  Indi-
viduals with this subtype can be divided in to two groups. Individu als with “urge incon-
tinence” have sudden urge symptoms and de trusor instability, whereas individuals with
“voiding postponement” consciously defer micturition urges until incontinence results",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,400
"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of enuresis  is repeated voiding of urine during the day or at night into
bed or clothes (Criterion A). Most often the voiding is involuntary, bu t occasionally it may",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,400
"356 Elimination Disorders
be intentional. To qualify for a diagnosis of  enuresis, the voiding of urine must occur at
least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months or must cause clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, academic (occu pational), or other im portant areas of func-
tioning (Criterion B). The indi vidual must have reached an age at which continence is
expected (i.e., a chronological age of at leas t 5 years or, for childre n with developmental
delays, a mental age of at least 5 years) (Cri terion C). The urinary incontinence is not at-
tributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a diuretic, an antipsychotic med-
ication) or another medical co ndition (e.g., diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure disorder)
(Criterion D)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,401
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
During nocturnal enuresis, occasionally the voiding takes place during rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep, and the child may recall a dream that involved the act of urinating. During day-
time (diurnal) enuresis, the child defers voiding until incontinence occurs, sometimes because
of a reluctance to use the toilet as a result of social anxiety or  a preoccupation with school or
play activity. The enuretic event most commonly occurs in the early afternoon on school days
and may be associated with symptoms of disr uptive behavior. The enuresis commonly per-
sists after appropriate treatment of an associat ed infection. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of enuresis is 5%–10% am ong 5-year-olds, 3%–5%  among 10-year-olds,
and around 1% among individuals 15 years or older",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,401
"Development and Course
Two types of course of enuresis have been de scribed: a “primary” type, in which the indi-
vidual has never established urinary continence, and a “secondary” type, in which the dis-
turbance develops after a period of establis hed urinary continence. There are no differences
in prevalence of comorbid me ntal disorders between the two types. By definition, primary
enuresis begins at age 5 years. The most co mmon time for the onset of secondary enuresis
is between ages 5 and 8 years, but it may occur at any time. After age 5 years, the rate of spon-
taneous remission is 5%–10% per year. Most ch ildren with the disord er become continent
by adolescence, but in approximately 1% of cases the disorder continues into adulthood",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,401
"Diurnal enuresis is uncommon after age 9 year s. While occasional diurnal incontinence is
not uncommon in middle childhood, it is substantially more common in those who also
have persistent nocturnal enures is. When enuresis persists in to late childhood or adoles-
cence, the frequency of incontinence may in crease, whereas continence in early childhood
is usually associated with a dec lining frequency of wet nights",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,401
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Environmental. A number of predisposing factors for enuresis have been suggested, in-
cluding delayed or lax toilet training and psychosocial stress",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,401
"Genetic and physiological. Enuresis has been associated with delays in the develop-
ment of normal circadian rhyt hms of urine production, with resulting nocturnal polyuria
or abnormalities of central v asopressin receptor sensitivity, and reduced functional blad-
der capacities with bladder hyperreactivity (unstable bladder syndrome). Nocturnal en-
uresis is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Heritability has been shown in family, twin,
and segregation analyses. Risk for childhood nocturnal enuresis is approximately 3.6 times
higher in offspring of enuretic mothers and 10.1 times higher  in the presence of paternal
urinary incontinence. The risk magnitudes fo r nocturnal enuresis and diurnal incontinence
are similar.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,401
"Encopresis 357
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
Enuresis has been reported in a variety of Eu ropean, African, and Asian countries as well
as in the United States. At a national level,  prevalence rates are remarkably similar, and
there is great similarity in the developmenta l trajectories found in different countries",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,402
"There are very high rates of enuresis in orphanages and other residential institutions,
likely related to the mode and environment in which toilet training occurs. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Nocturnal enuresis is more common in males. Diurnal incontinence is more common in fe-
males. The relative risk of having a child who develops enuresis is greater for previously
enuretic fathers than for pr eviously enuretic mothers. 
Functional Consequences of Enuresis
The amount of impairment associated with enur esis is a function of the limitation on the
child’s social activities (e.g., ineligibility fo r sleep-away camp) or its effect on the child’s
self-esteem, the degree of social ostracism by peers, and the anger, punishment, and rejec-
tion on the part of caregivers",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,402
"Differential Diagnosis
Neurogenic bladder or another medical condition. The diagnosis of enuresis is not made
in the presence of a neurogenic bladder or an other medical condition that causes polyuria or
urgency (e.g., untreated diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus) or during an acute urinary
tract infection. However, a diagnosis is compat ible with such conditions if urinary inconti-
nence was regularly present prior to the development of another me dical condition or if it per-
sists after the institution of appropriate treatment of the medical condition",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,402
"Medication side effects. Enuresis may occur during treatment with antipsychotic med-
ications, diuretics, or other medications that may induce incontinence. In this case, the di-
agnosis should not be made in isolation but may be noted as a medication side effect",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,402
"However, a diagnosis of enuresis may be made if urinary incontinence was regularly pres-
ent prior to treatment with the medication",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,402
"Comorbidity
Although most children with enuresis do not have a comorbid mental disorder, the prevalence
of comorbid behavioral symptoms is higher in children with enuresis than in children without
enuresis. Developmental delays, including speech, language, learning, and motor skills
delays, are also present in a portion of childr en with enuresis. Encopresis, sleepwalking, and
sleep terror disorder may be present. Urinar y tract infections are more common in children
with enuresis, especially the diurnal subtype, than in those who are continent",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,402

tion on physical examination or by history",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,403
"Subtypes
Feces in the with constipation and overflow incontinence subtype are characteristically
(but not invariably) poorly fo rmed, and leakage can be infr equent to cont inuous, occur-
ring mostly during the day and rarely during sleep. Only part of the feces is passed during
toileting, and the incontinence resolves after treatment of the constipation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,403
"In the without constipation and overflow inco ntinence subtype, feces are likely to be of
normal form and consistency, and soiling is intermittent. Feces may be deposited in a
prominent location. This is usually associated  with the presence of  oppositional defiant
disorder or conduct disorder or may be th e consequence of anal masturbation. Soiling
without constipation appears to be less common than soiling with constipation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,403
"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of encopresis is repeated passage of feces into in appropriate places (e.g.,
clothing or floor) (Criterion A). Most often the passage is involuntary but occasionally may be
intentional. The event must occur at least once a month for at least 3 months (Criterion B), and
the chronological age of the child must be at least 4 years (or for children with developmental
delays, the mental age must be at least 4 years)  (Criterion C). The fecal incontinence must not
be exclusively attributable to the physiological ef fects of a substance (e.g., laxatives) or another
medical condition except thr ough a mechanism involving constipation (Criterion D)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,403
"When the passage of feces is involuntary rath er than intentional, it is often related to
constipation, impaction, and retention with subsequent overflow. The constipation may
develop for psychological reasons (e.g., anxiet y about defecating in a particular place, a
more general pattern of anxious or oppositional behavior), leading to avoidance of defeca-
tion. Physiological predispositi ons to constipation include ineffectual straining or paradox-
ical defecation dynamics, with contraction rath er than relaxation of the external sphincter
or pelvic floor during straining for defecati on. Dehydration associated with a febrile ill-
ness, hypothyroidism, or a medication side ef fect can also induce constipation. Once con-
stipation has developed, it may be complicated by an anal fissure, painful defecation, and
further fecal retention. The con sistency of the stool may vary. In some individuals the stool
may be of normal or near-normal consistency. In other individuals—such as those with
overflow incontinence secondary to  fecal retention—it may be liquid",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,403
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
The child with encopresis often feels ashame d and may wish to avoid situations (e.g.,
camp, school) that might lead to embarrassment. The amount of impairment is a function
of the effect on the child's self-esteem, the degree of social ostracism by peers, and the an-
ger, punishment, and rejection on the part of  caregivers. Smearing feces may be deliberate
or accidental, resulting from the child’s attempt to clean or hide feces that were passed in-
voluntarily. When the incontinence is clearly deliberate, features of  oppositional defiant
disorder or conduct disorder may also be present. Many children with encopresis and
chronic constipation also have enuresis symp toms and may have associated urinary reflux
in the bladder or ureters that may lead to  chronic urinary infections, the symptoms of
which may remit with treatment of the constipation.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,403
"Other Specified Elimination Disorder 359
Prevalence
It is estimated that approximately 1% of 5-year-olds have encopresis, and the disorder is
more common in males than in females",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,404
"Development and Course
Encopresis is not diagnosed until a child has re ached a chronological ag e of at least 4 years
(or for children with developmental delays, a mental age of at least 4 years). Inadequate,
inconsistent toilet training and psychosocial st ress (e.g., entering school, the birth of a sib-
ling) may be predisposing factors. Two types of  course have been described: a “primary”
type, in which the individual has never established fecal continence, and a “secondary”
type, in which the disturbance develops after a period of established fecal continence. En-
copresis can persist, with interm ittent exacerbations, for years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,404
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. Painful defecation can lead to co nstipation and a cycle of with-
holding behaviors that make encopresis more likely. Use of some medications (e.g., anti-
convulsants, cough suppressants) may increase constipation and make encopresis more
likely",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,404
"Diagnostic Markers
In addition to physical examination, gastrointestinal imaging (e.g., abdominal radiograph)
may be informative to assess retained stool an d gas in the colon. Additional tests, such as
barium enema and anorectal ma nography, may be used to help exclude other medical
conditions, such as Hirschsprung’s disease",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,404
"Differential Diagnosis
A diagnosis of encopresis in the presence of  another medical condition is appropriate only
if the mechanism involves constipation that cannot be explained by other medical condi-
tions. Fecal incontinence related to other me dical conditions (e.g., chronic diarrhea, spina
bifida, anal stenosis) would not warrant a DSM-5 diagnosis of encopresis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,404

 Disorders
The DSM-5 classification  of sleep-wake disorders is intended for use by general

der, hypersomnolence disorder, narcolepsy, br eathing-related sleep disorders, circadian
rhythm sleep-wake disorders,  non–rapid eye movement (NRE M) sleep arousal disorders,
nightmare disorder, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syn-
drome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Individuals with these disor-
ders typically present with sleep-wake complain ts of dissatisfaction regarding the quality,
timing, and amount of sleep. Resulting dayt ime distress and impairme nt are core features
shared by all of these sleep-wake disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,406
"The organization of this chapter is designed to  facilitate differential diagnosis of sleep-
wake complaints and to clarify when referral to a sleep specialist is appropriate for further
assessment and treatment planning. The DSM-5 sleep disorders nosology uses a simple,
clinically useful approach, while also reflecti ng scientific advances  in epidemiology, ge-
netics, pathophysiology, assessment, and in terventions research since DSM-IV. In some
cases (e.g., insomnia disorder ), a “lumping” approach has been adopted, whereas in oth-
ers (e.g., narcolepsy), a “spli tting” approach has been taken, reflecting the availability of
validators derived from epidem iological, neurobiological, and interventions research. 
Sleep disorders are often accompanied by de pression, anxiety, an d cognitive changes
that must be addressed in treatment planni ng and management. Fu rthermore, persistent
sleep disturbances (both insomn ia and excessive sleepiness) ar e established risk factors for
the subsequent development of mental illne sses and substance use disorders. They may
also represent a prodromal expression of an episode of mental illness, allowing the possi-
bility of early intervention to preemp t or to attenuate a full-blown episode",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,406

medical condition (e.g., pain), or another sleep disorder (e.g., a breathing-related sleep dis-
order). For instance, insomnia may develop it s own course with some anxiety and depres-
sive features but in the absenc e of criteria being met for an y one mental disorder. Insomnia
may also manifest as a clinical feature of a more predominant ment al disorder . Persistent
insomnia may even be a risk factor for depression and is a common residual symptom af-
ter treatment for this condition. With comorb id insomnia and a mental disorder, treatment
may also need to target both conditions. Give n these different courses, it is often impossi-
ble to establish the precise nature of the rela tionship between these clinical entities, and
this relationship may change over time. Therefore, in th e presence of insomnia and a co-
morbid disorder, it is not ne cessary to make a causal attribution between the two condi-
tions. Rather, the diagnosis of insomnia disord er is made with concurrent specification of

The essential feature of insomnia disorder is dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality
with complaints of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. The sleep complaints are ac-
companied by clinically significant distress or  impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning. The sleep dist urbance may occur during the course of an-
other mental disorder or medical condition, or it  may occur independently",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,408
"Different manifestations of insomnia can oc cur at different times of the sleep period. Sleep-
onset insomnia  (or initial insomnia ) involves difficulty initia ting sleep at bedtime. Sleep mainte-
nance insomnia  (or middle insomnia ) involves frequent or prol onged awakenings throughout
the night. Late insomnia involves early-morning awakening with an inability to return to sleep",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,408
"Difficulty maintaining sleep is the most co mmon single symptom of insomnia, followed by
difficulty falling asleep, while a combination of  these symptoms is th e most common presen-
tation overall. The specific type of sleep comp laint often varies over time. Individuals who
complain of difficulty falling asleep at one time may later complain of difficulty maintaining
sleep, and vice versa. Symptoms of difficulty falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep
can be quantified by the individual’s retrospect ive self-report, sleep di aries, or other methods,
such as actigraphy or polysomnography, but th e diagnosis of insomnia disorder is based on
the individual’s subjecti ve perception of sleep or a caretaker’s report. 
Nonrestorative sleep,  a complaint of poor sleep quality that does not leave the individual
rested upon awakening despite adequate du ration, is a common sleep complaint usually
occurring in association with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or less frequently in
isolation. This complaint can also be reported in association with other sleep disorders
(e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder). When  a complaint of nonres torative sleep occurs
in isolation (i.e., in the absence of difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep) but all di-
agnostic criteria with regard to frequency, duration, and daytime distress and impairments
are otherwise met, a diagnosis of other specif ied insomnia disorder or unspecified insom-
nia disorder is made.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,408
"364 Sleep-Wake Disorders
Aside from the frequency and du ration criteria required to make the diagnosis, addi-
tional criteria are useful to quantify insomnia severity. These quantitative criteria, while
arbitrary, are provided for illustrative purpose only. For instance, difficulty initiating sleep
is defined by a subjective sleep latency greater than 20–30 minutes, and difficulty maintain-
ing sleep is defined by a subjective time awake after sleep onset greater than 20–30 min-
utes. Although there is no standard definition  of early-morning awakening, this symptom
involves awakening at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time and before total sleep
time reaches 6½ hours. It is essential to take into account no t only the final awakening time
but also the bedtime on the previ ous evening. Awakening at 4:00 A.M. does not have the
same clinical significance in those who go to bed at 9:00 P.M. as in those who go to bed at
11:00 P.M. Such a symptom may also reflect an age- dependent decrease in the ability to sus-
tain sleep or an age-dependent shift in the timing of the main sleep period. 
Insomnia disorder involves daytime impairments as well as nighttime sleep difficulties",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,409
"These include fatigue or, less commonly, dayt ime sleepiness; the latter is more common
among older individuals and wh en insomnia is comorbid with another medical condition
(e.g., chronic pain) or sleep disorder (e.g., sl eep apnea). Impairment in  cognitive performance
may include difficulties with attention, concentration and memory, and even with performing
simple manual skills. Associated mood disturba nces are typically described as irritability or
mood lability and less commonly as depressive or anxiety symptoms. Not all individuals with
nighttime sleep disturbances are distressed or have functional impairment. For example, sleep
continuity is often interrupted in healthy olde r adults who nevertheless identify themselves
as good sleepers. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder should be reserved for those individuals
with significant daytime distress or impairment related to their nighttime sleep difficulties",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,409
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
Insomnia is often associated  with physiological and cognitive arousal and conditioning
factors that interfere with sleep. A preoccupati on with sleep and distress due to the inabil-
ity to sleep may lead to a vicious cycle: the more the individual strives to sleep, the more
frustration builds and further im pairs sleep. Thus, excessive attention and efforts to sleep,
which override normal sleep-onset mechanisms, may contribute to the development of in-
somnia. Individuals with  persistent insomnia may also acquire maladapt ive sleep habits
(e.g., spending excessive time in bed; following an erratic sleep schedule; napping) and
cognitions (e.g., fear of sleeplessness; apprehensions of daytime impairments; clock mon-
itoring) during the course of the disorder. Engaging in such activities in an environment in
which the individual has frequently spent sleepless nights may further compound the con-
ditioned arousal and perpetuate sleep difficulties. Conversely, the individual may fall asleep
more easily when not trying to do so. Some individuals also report better sleep when away
from their own bedrooms and their usual routines. 
Insomnia may be accompanied by a variety of daytime complaints and symptoms, in-
cluding fatigue, decreased en ergy, and mood disturbances. Symptoms of anxiety or de-
pression that do not meet criteria for a specif ic mental disorder may be present, as well as
an excessive focus on the perceived effect s of sleep loss on daytime functioning. 
Individuals with inso mnia may have elevated scores on self-report psychological or
personality inventories with profiles indicati ng mild depression and anxiety, a worrisome
cognitive style, an emotion-focused and intern alizing style of conflict resolution, and a so-
matic focus. Patterns of neurocognitive impairment among individuals with insomnia dis-
order are inconsistent, although  there may be impairments in performing tasks of higher
complexity and those requiring frequent ch anges in performance strategy. Individuals
with insomnia often require more effo rt to maintain cognitive performance",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,409
"Prevalence
Population-based estimates indicate that about one-third of adults report insomnia symp-
toms, 10%–15% experience associated daytime impairments, and 6%–10% have symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,409
"Insomnia Disorder 365
that meet criteria for insomnia  disorder. Insomnia disorder is the most prevalent of all
sleep disorders. In primary care settings, approximately 10%–20% of individuals complain
of significant insomnia symp toms. Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among fe-
males than among males, with a gender ratio of about 1.44:1. Although insomnia can be a
symptom or an independent disorder, it is mo st frequently observed as a comorbid con-
dition with another medical condition or ment al disorder. For instance, 40%–50% of indi-
viduals with insomnia also present with a comorbid mental disorder. 
Development and Course
The onset of insomnia symptoms  can occur at any time during life, but the first episode is
more common in young adulthood. Less frequently, insomnia begins in childhood or ad-
olescence. In women, new-onset insomnia may occur during menopause and persist even
after other symptoms (e.g., hot flashes) have resolved. Insomnia may have a late-life onset,
which is often associated with the onse t of other health-related conditions. 
Insomnia can be situational, persistent, or recurrent. Situational or  acute insomnia usu-
ally lasts a few days or a few weeks and is often associated with life events or rapid changes
in sleep schedules or environment. It usually resolves once the initial precipitating event
subsides. For some individuals, perhaps those more vulnerable to sl eep disturbances, in-
somnia may persist long after the initial trigge ring event, possibly because of conditioning
factors and heightened arousal. The factors that precipitate insomnia may differ from
those that perpetuate it. For example, an in dividual who is bedridden with a painful injury
and has difficulty sleeping may then develop negative associations for sleep. Conditioned
arousal may then persist and lead to persiste nt insomnia. A similar course may develop in
the context of an acute psychological stress or a mental disorder. For instance, insomnia that
occurs during an episode of major depressive disorder can become a focus of attention,
with consequent negative conditioning, and pe rsist even after resolution of the depressive
episode. In some cases, insomnia may also have an insidious onse t without any identifi-
able precipitating factor. 
The course of insomnia may also be episodic,  with recurrent episodes of sleep difficul-
ties associated with the occurrence of stress ful events. Chronicity rates range from 45%
to 75% for follow-ups of 1–7 years. Even wh en the course of the insomnia has become
chronic, there is night-to -night variability in sleep patterns, with an occasional restful night’s
sleep interspersed with several nights of poor sleep. The characteristics of insomnia may
also change over time. Many individuals with insomnia have a history of “light” or easily
disturbed sleep prior to onset of more persistent sleep problems",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,410
"Insomnia complaints are mo re prevalent among middle-age and older adults. The type
of insomnia symptom changes as a function of age, with difficulties initiating sleep being
more common among young adults and proble ms maintaining sleep occurring more fre-
quently among middle-age and older individuals. 
Difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep can also occur in children and adolescents,
but there are more limited data on prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity during these
developmental phases of the lifespan. Sleep diff iculties in childhood can result from con-
ditioning factors (e.g., a child who does not lear n to fall asleep or return to sleep without
the presence of a parent) or from the absence of consistent sleep schedules and bedtime
routines. Insomnia in adolescenc e is often triggered or exacer bated by irregular sleep sched-
ules (e.g., phase delay). In both children an d adolescents, psycholo gical and medical fac-
tors can contribute to insomnia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,410
"The increased prevalence of insomnia in olde r adults is partly explained by the higher
incidence of physical health problems with aging. Changes in sleep patterns associated with
the normal developmental process must be diff erentiated from those exceeding age-related
changes. Although polysomnography is of limit ed value in the routine evaluation of in-
somnia, it may be more useful in the differen tial diagnosis among older adults because the
etiologies of insomnia (e.g., sleep apnea) are more often identifiable in older individuals.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,410
"366 Sleep-Wake Disorders
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
While the risk and prognostic factors discussed in this section increase vulnerability to in-
somnia, sleep disturbances are more likely to  occur when predisposed individuals are ex-
posed to precipitating events, such as major lif e events (e.g., illness, separation) or less
severe but more chronic daily stress. Most individuals resume normal sleep patterns after
the initial triggering event ha s disappeared, but others—perha ps those more vulnerable to
insomnia—continue experiencing persistent sleep difficulties. Perpetuating factors such as
poor sleep habits, irregular sleep scheduling, an d the fear of not sleeping feed into the in-
somnia problem and may contribute to a vicious  cycle that may induce persistent insomnia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,411

may also increase vulnerability to insomnia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,411
"Genetic and physiological. Female gender and advancing age are associated with in-
creased vulnerability to insomn ia. Disrupted sleep and insomnia display a familial dispo-
sition. The prevalence of insomnia is hi gher among monozygoti c twins relative to
dizygotic twins; it is also higher in first-degree family members comp ared with the general
population. The extent to which this link is  inherited through a genetic predisposition,

often associated with the birth of a new child or with menopause. Despite higher preva-
lence among older females, polysomnographic studies su ggest better preservation of
sleep continuity and slow-wave sleep in  older females than in older males",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,411

"The severity of these sleep im pairments does not always ma tch the individual’s clinical
presentation or subjective complaint of poor sleep, as individuals with insomnia often un-
derestimate sleep duration and overestimate wakefulness relative to polysomnography",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,411
"Quantitative electroencephalographic analyses  may indicate that individuals with insom-
nia have greater high-frequency electroencepha lography power relative to good sleepers

suggestive of increased cortical arousal. Individual s with insomnia disorder may have a
lower sleep propensity and typically do not show increased daytime sleepiness on objec-
tive sleep laboratory measures compared wi th individuals without sleep disorders. 
Other laboratory measures show evidence, although not consistently, of increased
arousal and a generalized activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e.g., in-
creased cortisol levels, heart rate  variability, reactivity to stre ss, metabolic rate). In general,
findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased physiological and cognitive
arousal plays a significant role in insomnia disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,411

"Functional Consequences  of Insomnia Disorder
Interpersonal, social, and occupational problems may develop as a result of insomnia or
excessive concern with sleep, increased daytim e irritability, and poor concentration. De-
creased attention and concentrat ion are common and may be related to higher rates of ac-
cidents observed in insomnia. Persistent in somnia is also associated with long-term
consequences, including increased risks of ma jor depressive disorder, hypertension, and
myocardial infarction; increased absenteeism and reduced productivity at work; reduced
quality of life; and increased economic burden. 
Differential Diagnosis
Normal sleep variations. Normal sleep duration varies considerably across individuals",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,412
"Some individuals who require little sleep (“short sleepers”) may be concerned about their
sleep duration. Short sl eepers differ from individuals with insomnia disorder by the lack of
difficulty falling or staying asleep and by the absence of characteristic daytime symptoms
(e.g., fatigue, concentration pr oblems, irritability). However,  some short sleepers may desire
or attempt to sleep for a longer period of time and, by prolonging time in bed, may create an
insomnia-like sleep pattern. Clinical insomnia  also should be distinguished from normal,
age-related sleep changes. Insomnia must also be distinguished from sleep deprivation due
to inadequate opportunity or circumstance for sleep resulting, for example, from an emer-
gency or from professional or  family obligations forcing th e individual to stay awake. 
Situational/acute insomnia. Situational/acute insomnia  is a condition lasting a few days
to a few weeks, often associated with life events  or with changes in sleep schedules. These
acute or short-term insomnia symptoms may also produce si gnificant distress and inter-
fere with social, personal, and occupational functioning. When such symptoms are fre-
quent enough and meet all other criteria exce pt for the 3-month duration, a diagnosis of
other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,412

port sleep-onset insomnia only when they try to  sleep at socially normal times, but they do
not report difficulty falling asleep or stayin g asleep when their bed and rising times are

insomnia disorder by the history of recent shift work. 
Restless legs syndrome. Restless legs syndrome often produces difficulties initiating
and maintaining sleep. However, an urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleas-
ant leg sensations are features that differentiate this disorder fr om insomnia disorder. 
Breathing-related sleep disorders. Most individuals with a breathing-related sleep dis-
order have a history of loud snoring, breath ing pauses during sleep, and excessive daytime
sleepiness. Nonetheless, as many as 50% of individuals with sleep apnea may also report

etiologically related to the insomnia (see  “Substance/Medicatio n-Induced Sleep Disor-
der” later in this chapter). Fo r example, insomnia occurring only in the context of heavy

"Comorbidity
Insomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including diabetes, cor-
onary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulm onary disease, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and
other chronic pain conditions. The risk relati onship appears to be bidirectional: insomnia
increases the risk of medical conditions, and medical problems increase the risk of insom-
nia. The direction of the relationship is not always clear and may change over time; for this
reason, comorbid insomnia is the preferred terminology in th e presence of coexisting in-
somnia with another medical co ndition (or mental disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,413

"Diagnostic Features
Hypersomnolence  is a broad diagnostic term and incl udes symptoms of excessive quantity
of sleep (e.g., extended nocturnal sleep or involuntary daytime sleep),  deteriorated quality
of wakefulness (i.e., sleep propensity duri ng wakefulness as shown by difficulty awaken-
ing or inability to remain awake when required ), and sleep inertia (i.e., a period of im-
paired performance and reduced vigilance following awakening from the regular sleep
episode or from a nap) (Criterion A). Indivi duals with this disorder fall asleep quickly and
have a good sleep efficiency (>90%). They may have difficulty waking up in the morning,
sometimes appearing confused, co mbative, or ataxic. This pr olonged impairment of alert-
ness at the sleep-wake transition  is often referred to as sleep inertia  (i.e., sleep drunkenness)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,414
"It can also occur upon awaken ing from a daytime nap. During that period, the individual
appears awake, but there is a decline in moto r dexterity, behavior may be very inappro-
priate, and memory deficits, di sorientation in time and spac e, and feelings of grogginess
may occur. This period may last some minutes to hours. 
The persistent need for sleep can lead to auto matic behavior (usually of a very routine,
low-complexity type) that the individual carrie s out with little or no subsequent recall. For
example, individuals may find themselves having driven several miles from where they
thought they were, unaware of the “automatic”  driving they did in the preceding minutes",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,414
"For some individuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode (for most
individuals, nocturnal sleep) has a duration of 9 hours or more. However, the sleep is often
nonrestorative and is followed by difficulty awakening in the morning. For other individ-
uals with hypersomnolence disorder, the majo r sleep episode is of normal nocturnal sleep
duration (6–9 hours). In these cases, the excessive sleepiness is characterized by several un-
intentional daytime naps. These daytime naps tend to be relatively long (often lasting 1 hour
or more), are experienced as no nrestorative (i.e., unrefreshing),  and do not lead to improved
alertness. Individuals with hypersomnolence have daytime naps near ly everyday regard-
less of the nocturnal sleep duration. Subjective  sleep quality may or may not be reported as

television, or driving long dist ances), but in more severe cases they can manifest in high-
attention situations such as at work, in meetings, or at social gatherings",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,415
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Nonrestorative sleep, automatic behavior, di fficulties awakening in the morning, and
sleep inertia, although common in hypersomnolence disorder, may also be seen in a variety
of conditions, including narcolepsy. Appr oximately 80% of indi viduals with hyper-
somnolence report that their sleep is nonres torative, and as many have difficulties awak-
ening in the morning. Sleep inertia, thou gh less common (i.e., observed in 36%–50% of
individuals with hypersomnolence disorder), is highly specific to hypersomnolence. Short
naps (i.e., duration of less than 30 minutes)  are often unrefreshing. Individuals with hy-
persomnolence often appear sleepy and may even  fall asleep in the clinician’s waiting
area. 
A subset of individuals with hypersomnolenc e disorder have a family history of hy-
persomnolence and also have symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, in-
cluding recurrent vascular-type headaches, reactivity of the peripheral vascular system
(Raynaud’s phenomenon), and fainting",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,415
"Prevalence
Approximately 5%–10% of individuals who cons ult in sleep disorders clinics with com-
plaints of daytime sleepiness are diagnosed as having hypersomnolence disorder. It is es-
timated that about 1% of the European and U.S. general population has episodes of sleep
inertia. Hypersomnolence occurs with relati vely equal frequency in males and females",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,415
"Development and Course
Hypersomnolence disorder has a persistent course, with a prog ressive evolution in the se-
verity of symptoms. In most extreme cases, sl eep episodes can last up to 20 hours. How-
ever, the average nighttime sleep duration is  around 9½ hours. While many individuals
with hypersomnolence are able to reduce their sleep time during working days, weekend
and holiday sleep is greatly increased (by up to 3 hours). Awakenings are very difficult
and accompanied by sleep inertia episodes in nearly 40% of cases. Hypersomnolence fully
manifests in most cases in late adolescence or early adulthood, with a mean age at onset of
17–24 years. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are diagnosed, on average, 10–15
years after the appearance of the firs t symptoms. Pediatric cases are rare. 
Hypersomnolence has a progressive onset, wi th symptoms beginning between ages 15
and 25 years, with a gradual progression over weeks to months. For most individuals, the
course is then persistent and stable, unless tr eatment is initiated. The development of other
sleep disorders (e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder) may worsen the degree of sleepi-
ness. Although hyperactivity may be one of th e presenting signs of daytime sleepiness in
children, voluntary napping increases with ag e. This normal phenomenon is distinct from
hypersomnolence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,415

and alcohol use, but they have not been documented as environmental precipitating
factors. Viral infections have been report ed to have preceded or accompanied hyper-
somnolence in about 10% of cases. Viral infections, such as HIV pneumonia, infectious
mononucleosis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, can also evolve into hypersomnolence within",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,415

months after the infection. Hypersomnolenc e can also appear within 6–18 months follow-
ing a head trauma. 
Genetic and physiological. Hypersomnolence may be fami lial, with an autosomal-
dominant mode of  inheritance. 
Diagnostic Markers
Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrates a no rmal to prolonged sleep duration, short
sleep latency, and normal to increased slee p continuity. The distribution of rapid eye
movement (REM) sleep is also normal. Sleep e fficiency is mostly greater than 90%. Some
individuals with hypersomnolence disorder have increased amounts of slow-wave sleep",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,416
"The multiple sleep latency te st documents sleep tendency, typically indicated by mean
sleep latency values of less than 8 minutes.  In hypersomnolence disorder, the mean sleep
latency is typically less than 10 minutes and fr equently 8 minutes or less. Sleep-onset REM
periods (SOREMPs; i.e., the occurrence of REM sleep within 20 minutes of sleep onset)
may be present but occur less than two time s in four to five nap opportunities. 
Functional Consequences of Hypersomnolence Disorder
The low level of alertness that occurs while an individual fights the need for sleep can lead
to reduced efficiency, diminished concentration, and poor memory during daytime activ-
ities. Hypersomnolence can lead to significan t distress and dysfunction in work and social
relationships. Prolonged nocturnal sleep and difficulty awakening can result in difficulty
in meeting morning obligations, such as arrivi ng at work on time. Unintentional daytime
sleep episodes can be embarrassing and even dangerous, if, for instance, the individual is
driving or operating machinery when the episode occurs. 
Differential Diagnosis
Normative variation in sleep. “Normal” sleep duration varies considerably in the general
population. “Long sleepers” (i.e., individuals who require a greater than average amount
of sleep) do not have excessive sleepiness, sleep  inertia, or automatic behavior when they
obtain their required amount of nocturnal sleep . Sleep is reported to be refreshing. If social
or occupational demands lead to shorter nocturnal sleep, daytime symptoms may appear",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,416
"In hypersomnolence disorder, by contrast, symp toms of excessive sleepiness occur regard-
less of nocturnal sleep duration. An inad equate amount of no cturnal sleep, or behaviorally
induced insufficient sleep syndrome,  can produce symptoms of daytime sleepiness very similar
to those of hypersomnolence. An average slee p duration of fewer than 7 hours per night
strongly suggests inadequate nocturnal sleep , and an average of more than 9–10 hours of
sleep per 24-hour period suggests hypersomnole nce. Individuals with inadequate noctur-
nal sleep typically “catch up” with longer sleep durations on days when they are free from
social or occupational demands or on vaca tions. Unlike hypersom nolence, insufficient
nocturnal sleep is unlikely to persist unabat ed for decades. A diagnosis of hypersomno-
lence disorder should not be made if there is  a question regarding the adequacy of noctur-
nal sleep duration. A diagnostic and therapeutic trial of sleep extension for 10–14 days can
often clarify the diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,416
"Poor sleep quality and fatigue. Hypersomnolence disorder should be distinguished
from excessive sleepiness related to insufficient  sleep quantity or quality and fatigue (i.e.,
tiredness not necessarily relieved by increase d sleep and unrelated to sleep quantity or
quality). Excessive sleepiness and fatigue ar e difficult to differentiate and may overlap
considerably.

related sleep disorders may have similar patterns of excessive sleepiness. Breathing-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,416

related sleep disorders are suggested by a hist ory of loud snoring, pauses in breathing
during sleep, brain injury, or cardiovascular disease and by the presence of obesity, oro-
pharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, hyperten sion, or heart failure on physical examina-
tion. Polysomnographic studies can confirm the presence of apneic events in breathing-
related sleep disorder (and their ab sence in hypersomnolence disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,417
"Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are
often characterized by daytime sleepiness. A  history of an abnormal sleep-wake schedule
(with shifted or irregular hours) is present in individuals with a circadian rhythm sleep-
wake disorder. 
Parasomnias. Parasomnias rarely produce the prol onged, undisturbed nocturnal sleep
or daytime sleepiness characterist ic of hypersomnolence disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,417
"Other mental disorders. Hypersomnolence disorder must be distinguished from mental
disorders that include hypersomnolence as an essential or associated fe ature. In particular,
complaints of daytime sleepiness may occur in a major depressive  episode, with atypical fea-
tures, and in the depressed phase of bipolar di sorder. Assessment for ot her mental disorders is
essential before a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder is co nsidered. A diagnosis of hyper-
somnolence disorder can be made in the presence  of another current or past mental disorder. 
Comorbidity
Hypersomnolence can be associated with depressive disorders, bipolar disorders (during a
depressive episode), and major depressive disorder, with seas onal pattern. Many individu-
als with hypersomnolence disorder have symptoms  of depression that may meet criteria for
a depressive disorder. This presentation may be  related to the psycho social consequences of
persistent increased sleep need. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are also at
risk for substance-related disord ers, particularly related to self-medication with stimulants",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,417

struction of hypocretin neuron s, test results for HLA DQB1* 06:02 may be positive and may
result from the insult triggeri ng the autoimmune process. In other cases, the destruction of
hypocretin neurons may be secondary to trau ma or hypothalamic surgery. Head trauma
or infections of the central nervous system can, however, produce tran sitory decreases in
CSF hypocretin-1 levels without hypocret in cell loss, complicating the diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,419
"Diagnostic Features
The essential features of sleepiness in narcolep sy are recurrent daytime naps or lapses into
sleep. Sleepiness typica lly occurs daily but must occur at a minimum three times a week
for at least 3 months (Criterion A). Narcolep sy generally produces cataplexy, which most
commonly presents as brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of sudden, bilateral loss of mus-
cle tone precipitated by emotions, typically  laughing and joking. Muscles affected may
include those of the neck, jaw, arms, legs, or  whole body, resulting in head bobbing, jaw
dropping, or complete falls. Individuals are awake and aware during cataplexy. To meet
Criterion B1(a), cataplexy must be triggered by  laughter or joking and must occur at least
a few times per month when the condition is untreated or in the past",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,419
"Cataplexy should not be confused with “wea kness” occurring in the context of athletic
activities (physiological) or ex clusively after unusual emotiona l triggers such as stress or
anxiety (suggesting possible psychopathology). Episodes lasting hours or days, or those not
triggered by emotions, are unlikely to be cata plexy, nor is rolling on the floor while laugh-
ing hysterically",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,419
"In children close to onset, genuine cataplexy can be atypical, affecting primarily the
face, causing grimaces or jaw opening with tongue thrusting (“cataplectic faces”). Alter-
natively, cataplexy may present as low-grad e continuous hypotonia, yielding a wobbling
walk. In these cases, Criterion B1(b) can be met in children or in individuals within 6 months
of a rapid onset",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,419
"Narcolepsy-cataplexy nearly always results from the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin
(orexin)–producing cells, causin g hypocretin deficiency (less than or equal to one-third of
control values, or 110 pg/mL in most laboratori es). Cell loss is likely autoimmune, and ap-
proximately 99% of affected individuals carry HLA-DQB1*06:02 (vs. 12%–38% of control
subjects). Thus, checking  for the presence of DQB1*06:02 pr ior to a lumbar puncture for eval-
uation of CSF hypocretin-1 immu noreactivity may be useful. Ra rely, low CSF levels of hypo-
cretin-1 occur without cataplexy, notably in youths who may develop cataplexy later. CSF
hypocretin-1 measurement represents the gold standard, excepting associated severe con-
ditions (neurological, inflammatory, infectious , trauma) that can inte rfere with the assay",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,419
"A nocturnal polysomnographic sleep study followed by an MSLT can also be used to
confirm the diagnosis (Criterion B3). These tests must be performed after the individual
has stopped all psychotropic medications, fo llowing 2 weeks of adequate sleep time (as
documented with sleep diaries, actigraphy). Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency
(sleep-onset REM period, REM latency less than  or equal to 15 minutes) during polysom-
nography is sufficient to confirm the diagnosi s and meets Criterion B3. Alternatively, the
MSLT result must be positive, showing a mean sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 min-
utes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods in four to five naps",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,419
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
When sleepiness is severe, automatic behavior s may occur, with the individual continuing
his or her activities in a semi-automatic, ha zelike fashion without memory or conscious-
ness. Approximately 20%–60% of individuals experience vivid hypnagogic hallucinations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,419

before or upon falling asleep or hypnopompic  hallucinations just after awakening. These
hallucinations are distinct from the less vivid, nonhallucinatory dreamlike mentation at
sleep onset that occurs in normal sleepers.  Nightmares and vivid dreaming are also fre-
quent in narcolepsy, as is REM sleep behavior disorder. Approximately 20%–60% of indi-
viduals experience sleep paralysis upon falling asleep or awakening, leaving them awake
but unable to move or speak. However, many  normal sleepers also report sleep paralysis,
especially with stress or slee p deprivation. Nocturnal eating  may occur. Obesity is com-
mon. Nocturnal sleep disruption with freque nt long or short awakenings is common and
can be disabling",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,420
"Individuals may appear sleepy or fall asleep in the waiting area or during clinical ex-
amination. During cataplexy, individuals may slump in a chair and have slurred speech or
drooping eyelids. If the clinician has time to  check reflexes during cataplexy (most attacks
are less than 10 seconds), reflexes are abo lished—an important finding distinguishing gen-
uine cataplexy from conversion disorder. 
Prevalence
Narcolepsy-cataplexy affects 0.02%–0.04% of the general population in most countries",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,420
"Narcolepsy affects both genders, with possibly a slight male preponderance. 
Development and Course 
Onset is typically in children and adolescents/young adults but rarely in older adults",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,420
"Two peaks of onset are suggested, at ages 15–25 years and ages 30–35 years. Onset can be
abrupt or progressive (over years). Severity is highest when onset is abrupt in children,
and then decreases with age or with treatment, so that symptoms such as cataplexy can oc-
casionally disappear. Abrupt onset in young, prepubescent children can be associated
with obesity and premature puberty, a phenotype more frequently observed since 2009. In
adolescents, onset is more difficu lt to pinpoint. Onset in adults is often unclear, with some
individuals reporting having ha d excessive sleepiness since bi rth. Once the disorder has
manifested, the course is persistent and lifelong",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,420
"In 90% of cases, the first symptom to manife st is sleepiness or in creased sleep, followed
by cataplexy (within 1 year in 50% of cases, within 3 years in 85%). Sleepiness, hypnagogic
hallucinations, vivid dreaming , and REM sleep behavior disorder (excessive movements
during REM sleep) are early symptoms. Excessiv e sleep rapidly progresses to an inability
to stay awake during the day, and to maintain  good sleep at night, without a clear increase
in total 24-hour sleep needs. In the first months, cataplexy may be atypical, especially in
children. Sleep paralysis usually develops ar ound puberty in child ren with prepubertal
onset. Exacerbations of symptoms suggest la ck of compliance with medications or devel-
opment of a concurrent sleep disorder, notably sleep apnea",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,420
"Young children and adolescents with narcolepsy often develop a ggression or behav-
ioral problems secondary to sleepiness and/ or nighttime sleep disruption. Workload and
social pressure increase thro ugh high school and college, reducing available sleep time at
night. Pregnancy does not seem  to modify symptoms consisten tly. After retirement, indi-
viduals typically have more opportunity for napping, reducing the need for stimulants",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,420

uals with narcolepsy versus 2%–4% of control subjects or individuals with other sleep dis-

ings are uninterpretable when the individual is severely ill with a concurrent infection or

"Functional Consequenc es of Narcolepsy 
Driving and working are impaired, and indivi duals with narcolepsy should avoid jobs
that place themselves (e.g., working with mach inery) or others (e.g., bus driver, pilot) in
danger. Once the narcolepsy is controlled wi th therapy, patients can usually drive, al-
though rarely long distances alone. Untreated individuals are also at risk for social isola-
tion and accidental injury to themselves or  others. Social relations may suffer as these
individuals strive to avert cataplexy by exerting control over emotions.

guished based on distinctive clinical and labo ratory features. Individuals with hypersom-
nolence typically have longer and less disrupted nocturnal sleep, greater difficulty
awakening, more persistent daytime sleepine ss (as opposed to more discrete “sleep at-
tacks” in narcolepsy), longer and less refreshing daytime sleep episodes, and little or no
dreaming during daytime naps. By contrast, individuals with narcolepsy have cataplexy
and recurrent intrusions of elements of REM sleep into the transition between sleep and
wakefulness (e.g., sleep-related hallucination s and sleep paralysis). The MSLT typically
demonstrates shorter sleep latenc ies (i.e., greater physiological  sleepiness) as well as the
presence of multiple sleep-onset REM periods in individuals with narcolepsy",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,422
"Sleep deprivation and insufficient nocturnal sleep. Sleep deprivation and insufficient
nocturnal sleep are common in adolescents and shift workers. In adolescents, difficulties
falling asleep at night are common, causing sleep deprivation. The MSLT result may be

phase delayed. 
Sleep apnea syndromes. Sleep apneas are especially likely in the presence of obesity",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,422
"Because obstructive sleep apnea is more freque nt than narcolepsy, ca taplexy may be over-
looked (or absent), and the individual is as sumed to have obstructive sleep apnea unre-
sponsive to usual therapies. 
Major depressive disorder. Narcolepsy or hypersomnia may be associated or confused
with depression. Cataplexy is not present in depression. The MSLT re sults are most often
normal, and there is dissociation between subj ective and objective sleepiness, as measured
by the mean sleep latency during the MSLT",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,422

such as long-lasting cataplexy or unusual tr iggers, may be present in conversion disorder

long-lasting pseudocataplexy may occur during consultation, allowing the examining
physician enough time to verify reflexes, which remain intact.

zures characterized by isolated atonia are rare ly seen in isolation of other seizures, and
they also have signatures on  the electroencephalogram.

chorea or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal
infections, especially in the co ntext of a strep throat infectio n and high antistreptolysin O

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is the most  common breathing-related sleep disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,424
"It is characterized by repeated episodes of upper (pharyngeal) airw ay obstruction (apneas
and hypopneas) during sleep. Apnea  refers to the total absence of airflow, and hypopnea  re-
fers to a reduction in airflow. Each apnea or  hypopnea represents a reduction in breathing
of at least 10 seconds in duration in adults or two missed breaths in children and is typi-
cally associated with drops in oxygen saturation  of 3% or greater and/or an electroenceph-
alographic arousal. Both sleep-related (nocturnal) and wake-time symptoms are common",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,424
"The cardinal symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are snoring and daytime
sleepiness. 
Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea in adults  is diagnosed on the basis of polysom-
nographic findings and symptoms. The diagnosis is based on symptoms of 1) nocturnal
breathing disturbances (i.e., snoring, snorti ng/gasping, breathing pauses during sleep), or
2) daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshi ng sleep despite suffic ient opportunities to
sleep that are not better explained by another mental disorder and not attributable to an-
other medical condition, along with 3) eviden ce by polysomnography of five or more ob-
structive apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A1). Diagnosis can be made in
the absence of these symptoms if there is evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more ob-
structive apneas and/or hypopneas pe r hour of sleep (Criterion A2). 
Specific attention to disturbe d sleep occurring in association with snoring or breathing
pauses and physical findings that increase ri sk of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g.,
central obesity, crowded pharyngeal airway, el evated blood pressure) is needed to reduce
the chance of misdiagnosing this treatable condition",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,424
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Because of the frequency of nocturnal awakenin gs that occur with obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea, individuals may report symptoms  of insomnia. Other common, though non-
specific, symptoms of obstructive sleep apne a hypopnea are heartbur n, nocturia, morning
headaches, dry mouth, erectile  dysfunction, and reduced li bido. Rarely, individuals may
complain of difficulty breathing while lying supine or sleeping. Hypertension may occur
in more than 60% of individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,424
"Prevalence
Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is a very common disorder, affecting at least 1%–2% of
children, 2%–15% of middle-age adults, and mo re than 20% of older individuals. In the
general community, prevalence  rates of undiagnosed obst ructive sleep apnea hypopnea
may be very high in elderly individuals. Sinc e the disorder is strongly associated with obe-
sity, increases in obesity rates are likely to be accompanied by an increased prevalence of
this disorder. Prevalen ce may be particularly high amon g males, older adults, and certain
racial/ethnic groups. In adults, the male-to-female ratio of obstructive sleep apnea hypop-
nea ranges from 2:1 to 4:1. Ge nder differences decline in olde r age, possibly because of an
increased prevalence in females after menopause. There is no gender difference among
prepubertal children",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,424
"Development and Course
The age distribution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea likely follows a J-shaped distri-
bution. There is a peak in children ages 3–8 years when the nasopharynx may be compro-
mised by a relatively large mass of tonsillar tissue compared with the size of the upper",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,424
"380 Sleep-Wake Disorders
airway. With growth of the airway and regression of lymphoid tissue during later child-
hood, there is reduction in prevalence. Then, as obesity prevalence increases in midlife and
females enter menopause, obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea again increases. The course
in older age is unclear; the disorder may level off after age 65 years, but in other individ-
uals, prevalence may increase with aging. Beca use there is some age dependency of the oc-
currence of apneas and hypopneas, polysomnog raphic results must be interpreted in light
of other clinical data. In particular, signific ant clinical symptoms of insomnia or hyper-
somnia should be investigated re gardless of the individual’s age",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,425
"Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea usually ha s an insidious onset, gradual progression,
and persistent course. Typically the loud snorin g has been present for many years, often since
childhood, but an increase in its severity may lead the individual to seek evaluation. Weight
gain may precipitate an increase in sympto ms. Although obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea
can occur at any age, it most commonly mani fests among individuals ages 40–60 years. Over
4–5 years, the average apnea hypo pnea index increases in adults and older individuals by ap-
proximately two apneas/hypopneas per hour. Th e apnea hypopnea index is increased and in-
cident obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is greater among indivi duals who are older, who are
male, or who have a higher baseline body mass  index (BMI) or increa se their BMI over time",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,425
"Spontaneous resolution of obstructive sleep ap nea hypopnea has been reported with weight
loss, particularly after bariatric surgery. In children, seasonal va riation in obstructive sleep ap-
nea hypopnea has been observed, as has improvement with overall growth",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,425
"In young children, the signs and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may be
more subtle than in adults, making diagnosis more difficult to establish. Polysomnography is
useful in confirming diagnosis. Evidence of  fragmentation of sleep on the polysomnogram
may not be as apparent as in studies of older individuals, possibly because of the high homeo-
static drive in young individuals. Symptoms su ch as snoring are usually parent-reported and
thus have reduced sensitivity. Agitated arousals and unusual sleep postures, such as sleeping
on the hands and knees, may oc cur. Nocturnal enuresis also may occur and should raise the
suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea if it recurs in a child who was previously dry at
night. Children may also manife st excessive daytime sleepiness, although this is not as com-
mon or pronounced as in adults. Daytime mouth breathing, difficulty in swallowing, and poor
speech articulation are also common features in children. Children younger than 5 years more
often present with nighttime symptoms, such as  observed apneas or labored breathing, than
with behavioral symptoms (i.e., the nighttime symptoms are more noticeable and more often
bring the child to clinical attention). In childre n older than 5 years, daytime symptoms such as
sleepiness and behavioral problems (e.g., impulsivity and hyperactivity), attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, learning  difficulties, and morning head aches are more often the focus
of concern. Children with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may present with failure to
thrive and developmental delays. In young children, obesity is a less common risk factor,
while delayed growth and “failure to thrive” may be present",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,425
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. The major risk factors for ob structive sleep apnea hypopnea
are obesity and male gender. Others include maxillary-mandi bular retrognathia or micro-
gnathia, positive family history of sleep apnea, genetic syndromes that reduce upper
airway patency (e.g., Down’s syndrome, Trea cher Collin’s syndrome), adenotonsillar hy-
pertrophy (especially in youn g children), menopause (in fema les), and various endocrine
syndromes (e.g., acromegaly). Compared with  premenopausal females, males are at in-
creased risk for obstruct ive sleep apnea hypopnea, possibly reflecting the influences of sex
hormones on ventilatory control and body fat distribution, as well as because of gender
differences in airway structure. Medication s for mental disorders and medical conditions
that tend to induce somnolence may worsen the course of apnea symptoms if these med-
ications are not managed carefully.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,425
"Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea 381
Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has a strong  genetic basis, as evidenced by the sig-
nificant familial aggregation of the apnea hy popnea index. The prevalence of obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea is approximately twice as high among the first-degree relatives of
probands with obstructive sleep apnea hypopn ea as compared with members of control
families. One-third of the variance in the apnea hypopnea index is explained by shared fa-
milial factors. Although genetic markers with diagnostic or prognostic value are not yet
available for use, eliciting a family history of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea should in-
crease the clinical suspicion for the disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,426
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
There is a potential for sleepiness and fatigue to  be reported differently across cultures. In
some groups, snoring may be considered a si gn of health and thus may not trigger con-
cerns. Individuals of Asian ancestry may be at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea despite relatively low BMI, possibly reflecting the influence of craniofacial risk
factors that narrow the nasopharynx",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,426
"Gender-Related Issues 
Females may more commonly report fatigue rather than sleepiness and may underreport
snoring. 
Diagnostic Markers
Polysomnography provides quan titative data on frequency of sleep-related respiratory
disturbances and associated changes in oxygen saturation and sleep continuity. Polysom-
nographic findings in children differ from th ose in adults in that children demonstrate
labored breathing, partial obst ructive hypoventilation with cyclical desaturations, hyper-
capnia and paradoxical movements. Apnea hy popnea index levels as low as 2 are used to
define thresholds of abnormality in children",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,426
"Arterial blood gas measurements while the in dividual is awake are usually normal, but
some individuals can have waking hypoxemia or  hypercapnia. This pattern should alert the

ventricular function. Individuals with severe no cturnal oxygen desaturation may also have el-
evated hemoglobin or hematocrit values. Vali dated sleep measures (e.g., multiple sleep la-

has been reported in association with sympto ms of snoring and slee piness. Motor vehicle
crashes also have been reported to be as mu ch as sevenfold higher among individuals with
elevated apnea hypopnea index values. Clinicians should be cognizant of state govern-

obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, may be asso ciated with obesity, and some individuals
have concurrent narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. A diagnosis of narco-

concurrently to improve sleep",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,427
"Panic attacks. Nocturnal panic attacks may include symptoms of gasping or choking
during sleep that may be difficult to distinguish clinically from obst ructive sleep apnea hy-
popnea. However, the lower frequency of episo des, intense autonomic arousal, and lack of
excessive sleepiness differentiate nocturnal pa nic attacks from obstructive sleep apnea hy-
popnea. Polysomnography in individuals with nocturnal panic attacks does not reveal the
typical pattern of apneas or oxygen desaturation characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea. Individuals with obstructive slee p apnea hypopnea do not provide a history of
daytime panic attacks. 
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Attention-deficit/hyperact ivity disorder in chil-
dren may include symptoms of inattention, academic impairment, hyperactivity, and in-
ternalizing behaviors, all of which may also  be symptoms of chil dhood obstructive sleep
apnea hypopnea. The presence of other symptoms and signs of childhood obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., labored breathing or snoring during sleep and adenotonsillar
hypertrophy) would suggest the presence of obstructive sl eep apnea hypopnea. Obstruc-
tive sleep apnea hypopnea and attention-de ficit/hyperactivity disorder may commonly
co-occur, and there may be causal links between  them; therefore, risk factors such as en-

"Subtypes
Idiopathic central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes breathing are characterized by increased
gain of the ventilatory contro l system, also referred to as high loop gain,  which leads to in-
stability in ventilation and PaCO2 levels. This instability is termed periodic breathing and
can be recognized by hyperventilation alternating with hypoventilation. Individuals with
these disorders typically have pCO2 levels while awake that are slightly hypocapneic or
normocapneic. Central sleep apnea may also mani fest during initiation of treatment of ob-
structive sleep apnea hypopnea or may occur in association with obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea syndrome (termed complex sleep apnea ). The occurrence of central sleep apnea in
association with obstructive slee p apnea is also considered to be due to high loop gain. In
contrast, the pathogenesis of central sleep apnea comorbid wi th opioid use has been at-
tributed to the effects of opioids on the re spiratory rhythm generators in the medulla as
well as to its differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapneic respiratory drive. These
individuals may have elevated pCO2 levels while awake. Individuals receiving chronic
methadone maintenance therapy have been no ted to have increased somnolence and de-
pression, although the ro le of breathing disorders associated with opioid medication in caus-
ing these problems has not been studied. 
Specifiers
An increase in the central apnea index (i.e., number of central apneas per hour of sleep) re-
flects an increase in severity of central sleep apnea. Sleep continuity and quality may be
markedly impaired with reductions in restor ative stages of non–rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep (i.e., decreased slow-wav e sleep [stage N3]). In indi viduals with severe Cheyne-
Stokes breathing, the pattern can also be ob served during resting wakefulness, a finding
that is thought to be a poor prognostic marker for mortality. 
Diagnostic Features
Central sleep apnea disorders ar e characterized by repeated episodes of apneas and hy-

served during sleep. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of idiopathic central sleep apnea is unknown but thought to be rare. The
prevalence of Cheyne-Stokes breathing is high in individuals with depressed cardiac ven-
tricular ejection fraction. In individuals with an ejection fraction of less than 45%, the prev-
alence has been reported to be 20% or high er. The male-to-female ratio for prevalence is
even more highly skewed toward males than for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Prev-
alence increases with age, and most patients are older than 60 years. Cheyne-Stokes breath-
ing occurs in approximately 20% of individu als with acute stroke. Central sleep apnea
comorbid with opioid use occurs in approxim ately 30% of individuals taking chronic opi-
oids for nonmalignant pain and similarly in individuals receiving methadone mainte-
nance therapy. 
Development and Course
The onset of Cheyne-Stokes breathing appears tied to the deve lopment of heart failure. The
Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern is associated with oscillations in heart rate, blood pres-
sure and oxygen desaturation, and elevated sy mpathetic nervous system activity that can
promote progression of heart failure. The clinic al significance of Cheyne-Stokes breathing
in the setting of stroke is no t known, but Cheyne-Stokes breathing may be a transient find-
ing that resolves with time after acute stro ke. Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid
use has been documented with chro nic use (i.e., several months). 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is freq uently present in individu-
als with heart failure. The coexistence of atrial fibrillation further increases risk, as do older
age and male gender. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is also seen in association with acute stroke
and possibly renal failure. The underlying ventila tory instability in the setting of heart fail-
ure has been attributed to increased ventilatory chemos ensitivity and hyperventilation
due to pulmonary vascular congestion and ci rculatory delay. Central sleep apnea is seen
in individuals taking long-acting opioids",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,430

or depression. Hypoventilation may not be present during wakefulness",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,433
"Prevalence
Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation in adults is very uncommon. The prevalence of
congenital central alveolar hy poventilation is unknown, but the disorder is rare. Comor-
bid sleep-related hypoventilation (i.e., hypo ventilation comorbid with other conditions,
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseas e [COPD], neuromuscular disorders, or obe-
sity) is more common",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,433
"Development and Course
Idiopathic sleep-related hypove ntilation is thought to be a slowly progressive disorder of
respiratory impairment. When th is disorder occurs comorbidly  with other disorders (e.g.,
COPD, neuromuscular disorders, obesity), diseas e severity reflects the severity of the un-
derlying condition, and the disorder progre sses as the condition worsens. Complications
such as pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmon ale, cardiac dysrhythmias, polycythemia,
neurocognitive dysfunction, and worsening re spiratory failure can develop with increas-
ing severity of blood gas abnormalities. 
Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation  usually manifests at birth with shallow,
erratic, or absent breathing. This disorder can also manifest during infancy, childhood,
and adulthood because of va riable penetrance of the PHOX2B  mutation. Children with
congenital central alveolar hypo ventilation are more likely to have disorders of the auto-
nomic nervous system, Hirschsprung’s disease, neural crest tumors, and characteristic box-
shaped face (i.e., the face is short relative to its width)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,433
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Environmental. Ventilatory drive can be reduced in  individuals using central nervous
system depressants, including benzod iazepines, opiates, and alcohol. 
Genetic and physiological. Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is associated with
reduced ventilatory drive due to a blunted chemoresponsiveness to CO2 (reduced respi-
ratory drive; i.e., “won’t brea the”), reflecting underlying neurological deficits in centers
governing the control of ventilation. More co mmonly, sleep-related hypoventilation is co-
morbid with another medical condition, su ch as a pulmonary diso rder, a neuromuscular
or chest wall disorder, or hypothyroidism, or with use of medications (e.g., benzodiaze-
pines, opiates). In these conditions, the hy poventilation may be a consequence of in-
creased work of breathing and/or impairment of respiratory muscle function (i.e., “can’t
breathe”) or reduced respiratory drive (i.e., “won’t breathe”)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,433
"Neuromuscular disorders influence breathin g through impairment of respiratory mo-
tor innervation or respiratory muscle function. They include conditions such as amyo-
trophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury , diaphragmatic paralysis, myasthenia gravis,
Lambert-Eaton syndrome, toxic or metabolic myopathies, postpolio syndrome, and Char-
cot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. 
Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation is a genetic disorder at tributable to muta-
tions of PHOX2B,  a gene that is crucial for the de velopment of the embryonic autonomic
nervous system and neural crest derivatives. Children with congenital central alveolar hy-
poventilation show blunted vent ilatory responses to hypercapnia, especially in non–rapid
eye movement sleep.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,433
"Sleep-Related Hypoventilation 389
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Gender distributions for sleep-related hypove ntilation occurring in association with co-
morbid conditions reflect the gender distributions of the co morbid conditions. For exam-
ple, COPD is more frequently present in males and with increasing age. 
Diagnostic Markers 
Sleep-related hypoventilation is diagnosed using polysomnography showing sleep-related
hypoxemia and hypercapnia that is not better explained by another breathing-related sleep
disorder. The documentation of increased arterial pCO2 levels to greater than 55 mmHg
during sleep or a 10 mmHg or greater increase in pCO2 levels (to a level that also exceeds
50 mmHg) during sleep in comparison to awake supine values, for 10 minutes or longer, is
the gold standard for diagnosis. However, obtaining arterial blood gas determinations dur-
ing sleep is impractical, and non-invasive measures of pCO2 have not been adequately val-
idated during sleep and are not widely used during polysomnography in adults. Prolonged
and sustained decreases in oxyg en saturation (oxygen saturation of less than 90% for more
than 5 minutes with a nadir of at least 85%, or oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least
30% of sleep time) in the absence of evidence of upper airway obstruction are often used as
an indication of sleep- related hypoventilation; however, this  finding is not sp ecific, as there
are other potential causes of hypoxemia,  such as that due to lung disease",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,434
"Functional Consequences of 
Sleep-Related Hypoventilation
The consequences of sleep-related hypoventilati on are related to the effects of chronic ex-
posure to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. Th ese blood gas derangements cause vasocon-
striction of the pulmonary va sculature leading to pulmon ary hypertension, which, if
severe, can result in right-sided heart failure  (cor pulmonale). Hypo xemia can lead to dys-
function of organs such as the brain, blood,  and heart, leading to outcomes such as cog-
nitive dysfunction, polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypercapnia can depress
ventilatory drive, leading to pr ogressive respiratory failure. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other medical conditions affecting ventilation. In adults, the idiopathic variety of sleep-
related hypoventilation is very uncommon and is determined by excluding the presence of
lung diseases, skeletal malformations, neuromuscular disorders, and other medical and
neurological disorders or medications that affect ventilation. Sleep-related hypoventila-
tion must be distinguished from other causes of sleep-related hypoxemia, such as that due
to lung disease",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,434
"Other breathing-related sleep disorders. Sleep-related hypoventilation can be distin-
guished from obstructive sleep  apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea based on clinical

dysfunction and may occur in association with Hirschsprung’s disease. COPD, a disorder of
lower airway obstruction usually associated with cigarette sm oking, can result in sleep-
related hypoventilation and hypoxemia. The pres ence of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea is thought to exacerbate hypoxemia and hypercapnia during sleep and wakeful-
ness. The relationship between congenital central alveolar hypoventilation and idiopathic

Diagnostic Features
The delayed sleep phase type is based primarily on a history of a delay in the timing of the
major sleep period (usually more than 2 hours)  in relation to the desired sleep and wake-
up time, resulting in symptoms of insomnia and excessive sleepiness. When allowed to set
their own schedule, individuals with delayed sleep phase type exhibit normal sleep qual-
ity and duration for age. Symptoms of slee p-onset insomnia, diffic ulty waking in the
morning, and excessive early day sleepiness are prominent",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,436
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Common associated features of delayed sleep phase type include a hi story of mental dis-
orders or a concurrent mental disorder. Ex treme and prolonged difficulty awakening with
morning confusion is also common. Psychophy siological insomnia may develop as a re-
sult of maladaptive behaviors that impair sleep and increase arousal because of repeated
attempts to fall asleep at an earlier time",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,436
"Prevalence
Prevalence of delayed sleep phase type in the general population is approximately 0.17%
but appears to be greater than 7% in adolescents. Although the prevalence of familial de-
layed sleep phase type has not been established , a family history of delayed sleep phase is
present in individuals with delayed sleep phase type. 
Development and Course
Course is persistent, lasting longer than 3 mo nths, with intermittent  exacerbations through-
out adulthood. Although age at onset is variable, symptoms begin typically in adolescence
and early adulthood and persist for several mo nths to years before diagnosis is estab-
lished. Severity may decrease with ag e. Relapse of symptoms is common",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,436

date the delayed circadian sleep and wake timing can experience remission of symptoms. 
Increased prevalence in adolescence may be a consequence of both physiological and be-
havioral factors. Hormonal changes may be involved specifically, as delayed sleep phase is as-
sociated with the onset of puberty. Thus, de layed sleep phase type in adolescents should be

"Diagnostic Features
Advanced sleep phase type is characterized by sleep-wake times that are several hours
earlier than desired or conventional times. Di agnosis is based primarily on a history of an
advance in the timing of the major sleep period  (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to
the desired sleep and wake-up time, with sy mptoms of early morning insomnia and ex-
cessive daytime sleepiness. When allowed to  set their schedule, individuals with ad-
vanced sleep phase type will exhibit norm al sleep quality and duration for age. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with advanced sleep phase type are “morning types,” having earlier sleep-
wake times, with the timing of circadian biom arkers such as melatonin and core body tem-
perature rhythms occurring 2–4 hours earlier th an normal. When required to keep a con-
ventional schedule requiring a delay of bedtim e, these individuals will continue to have an
early rise time, leading to persistent sleep de privation and daytime sleepiness. Use of hyp-
notics or alcohol to combat sleep-maintenance insomnia and stimulants to reduce daytime
sleepiness may lead to substance abuse in these individuals. 
Prevalence
The estimated prevalence of advanced sleep phase type is approximately 1% in middle-
age adults. Sleep-wake times and circadian pha se advance in older individuals, probably
accounting for increased prevalence in this population",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,438
"Development and Course
Onset is usually in late adulthood. In the familial  form, onset can be earlier. The course is typ-
ically persistent, lasting more than 3 months, but the severity may increase depending on work
and social schedules. The advanced sleep pha se type is more common in older adults. 
Clinical expression may vary across the lif espan depending on social, school, and work
obligations. Individuals who can alter their work schedules to ac commodate the advanced
circadian sleep and wake timing can experience remission of symptoms. Increasing age
tends to advance the sleep phase, however, it is unclear whether the common age-associ-
ated advanced sleep phase type is due solely to a change in circadian timing (as seen in the
familial form) or also to age-related changes in the homeostatic regulation of sleep, result-
ing in earlier awakening. Severi ty, remission, and relapse of symptoms suggest lack of ad-
herence to behavioral and environmental trea tments designed to control sleep and wake
structure and lig ht exposure.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,438
"394 Sleep-Wake Disorders
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Environmental. Decreased late afternoon/early evening exposure to light and/or expo-
sure to early morning light du e to early morning awakening can increase the risk of ad-
vanced sleep phase type by advancing circadian rhythms. By going to bed early, these
individuals are not exposed to light in the phase delay region of the curve, resulting in per-
petuation of advanced phase. In familial adva nced sleep phase type, a shortening of the
endogenous circadian period can result in an advanced sleep phase, although circadian pe-
riod does not appear to system atically decrease with age.

orders, such as major neurocognitive disorder, and many neurodevelopmental disorders

Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type
Diagnostic Features
The diagnosis of non-24-hour sleep-wake type  is based primarily on a history of symp-
toms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness related to abnormal synchronization between the
24-hour light-dark cycle and the endogenous circadian rhythm. Individuals typically pre-
sent with periods of insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or both, which alternate with short
asymptomatic periods. Starting with the asymptomatic period, when the individual’s
sleep phase is aligned to the external envi ronment, sleep latency will gradually increase
and the individual will complain of sleep-onset insomnia. As the sleep phase continues to
drift so that sleep time is no w in the daytime, the individu al will have trouble staying
awake during the day and will complain of sleepiness. Because the circadian period is not
aligned to the external 24-hour environment,  symptoms will depend on when an individ-
ual tries to sleep in relation to the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Non-24-hour sleep-wake type is most common among blind or visually impaired individ-
uals who have decreased light perception. In si ghted individuals, there is often a history of
delayed sleep phase and of decreased exposure to light and structured social and physical
activity. Sighted individuals with non-24-h our sleep-wake type also demonstrate in-
creased sleep duration",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,441

Prevalence of non-24-hour sleep-wake type in the general population is unclear, but the
disorder appears rare in sighte d individuals. The prevalence in blind individuals is esti-
mated to be 50%",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,441
"Development and Course
Course of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is per sistent, with intermittent remission and ex-
acerbations due to changes in work and social schedules throughout the lifespan. Age at
onset is variable, depending on the onset of visual impairment. In sighted individuals, be-
cause of the overlap with delayed sleep phase  type, non-24-hour sleep-wake type may de-
velop in adolescence or early adulthood. Remi ssion and relapse of symptoms in blind and
sighted individuals largely depend on adhere nce to treatments designed to control sleep
and wake structure and light exposure",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,441
"Clinical expression may vary across the lif espan depending on social, school, and work
obligations. In adolescents and adults, irre gular sleep-wake schedules and exposure to
light or lack of light at critical times of the day can exacerbate the effects of sleep loss and
disrupt circadian entrainment. Consequently , symptoms of insomnia, daytime sleepiness,
and school, professional, and interpersonal functioning may worsen",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,441

"Functional Consequences of 
Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type
Complaints of insomnia (sleep onset and sleep  maintenance), excessive sleepiness, or both
are prominent. The unpredictability of sleep an d wake times (typically a daily delay drift)
results in an inability to attend  school or maintain a steady job and may increase potential
for social isolation. 
Differential Diagnosis
Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. In sighted individuals, non-24-hour sleep-wake
type should be differentiated from delayed sl eep phase type, as individuals with delayed
sleep phase type may display a similar progressive delay in sleep period for several days. 
Depressive disorders. Depressive symptoms and depressive disorders may result in
similar circadian dysregulation and symptoms. 
Comorbidity
Blindness is often comorbid with non-24-hour sleep-wake type, as are depressive and bi-
polar disorders with social isolation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,442
"Shift Work Type
Diagnostic Features
Diagnosis is primarily based on a history of th e individual working outside of the normal
8:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. daytime window (particularly at ni ght) on a regularly scheduled (i.e.,
non-overtime) basis. Symptoms of excessive sleepiness at work, and impaired sleep at
home, on a persistent basis are prominent. Pres ence of both sets of symptoms are usually
required for a diagnosis of shift work type. Ty pically, when the individual reverts to a day-
work routine, symptoms resolve. Although the etiology is slightly different, individuals
who travel across many time zones on a very frequent basis may experience effects similar
to those experienced by individuals with shift work type who work rotating shifts. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of shift work ty pe is unclear, but the disorder is estimated to affect 5%–10%
of the night worker population  (16%–20% of the workforce). Prevalence rises with advance-
ment into middle-age and beyond (Drake et al. 2004).",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,442
"398 Sleep-Wake Disorders
Development and Course
Shift work type can appear in individuals of any age but is more prevalent in individuals
older than 50 years and typically worsens with the passage of time if the disruptive work
hours persist. Although older adults may sh ow similar rates of circadian phase adjust-
ment to a change in routine as  do younger adults, they appear to experience significantly
more sleep disruption as a consequence of the circadian phase shift",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,443
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. Predisposing factors include a morn ing-type disposition, a need for
long (i.e., more than 8 hours) sleep duration s in order to feel well rested, and strong com-
peting social and domestic needs (e.g., parents of young children). Individuals who are able
to commit to a nocturnal lifestyle, with fe w competing day-oriented demands, appear at
lower risk for shift work type. 
Genetic and physiological. Because shift workers are more likely than day workers to
be obese, obstructive sleep apnea may be present and may exacerbate the symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,443
"Diagnostic Markers
A history and sleep diary or actigraphy may be  useful in diagnosis, as discussed earlier for
delayed sleep phase type. 
Functional Consequences  of Shift Work Type 
Individuals with shift work type not only ma y perform poorly at work but also appear to
be at risk for accidents both at work and on the drive home. They may also be at risk for
poor mental health (e.g., alcohol use diso rder, substance use diso rder, depression) and
physical health (e.g., gastrointestinal disorder s, cardiovascular dise ase, diabetes, cancer)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,443
"Individuals with a history of bipolar disorder  are particularly vulnerable to shift work
type–related episodes of mania resulting from missed nights of sleep. Shift work type of-
ten results in interpersonal problems. 
Differential Diagnosis
Normative variations in sleep with shift work. The diagnosis of shift work type, as op-
posed to the “normal” difficulties of shift wo rk, must depend to some  extent on the sever-
ity of symptoms and/or level of distress experienced by the individual. Presence of shift
work type symptoms even when the individual is able to live on a da y-oriented routine for
several weeks at a time may suggest the presence  of other sleep disord ers, such as sleep ap-
nea, insomnia, and narcolepsy, which should be ruled out. 
Comorbidity
Shift work type has been associated with in creased alcohol use disorder, other substance
use disorders, and depression. A variety of physical health disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal
disorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, ca ncer) have been found to be associated with
prolonged exposure to shift work",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,443

Diagnostic Features 
The essential feature of non– rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders is the
repeated occurrence of incomple te arousals, usually beginning during the first third of the
major sleep episode (Criterion A), that typica lly are brief, lasting 1–10 minutes, but may be
protracted, lasting up to 1 hour. The maximum duration of an event is unknown. The eyes
are typically open during these events. Many individuals exhibit both subtypes of arousals
on different occasions, which underscores the unitary underlying pathophysiology. The
subtypes reflect varying degrees of simult aneous occurrence of wakefulness and NREM
sleep, resulting in complex behaviors arising from sleep with varying degrees of conscious
awareness, motor activity, and autonomic activation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,445
"The essential feature of sleepwalking is repeated episodes of complex motor behavior
initiated during sleep, including rising from bed and walking about (Criterion A1). Sleep-
walking episodes begin during any stage of NREM sleep, most commonly during slow-
wave sleep and therefore most often occurring during the firs t third of the night. During
episodes, the individual has reduced alertness and responsiveness, a blank stare, and rel-
ative unresponsiveness to communication with others or effo rts by others to awaken the
individual. If awakened during the episode (or on awakening the following morning), the
individual has limited recall for the episode. Af ter the episode, there may initially be a brief
period of confusion or difficult y orienting, followed by full recovery of cognitive function
and appropriate behavior. 
The essential feature of sleep terrors  is the repeated occurrenc e of precipitous awaken-
ings from sleep, usually beginning with a pani cky scream or cry (Criterion A2). Sleep ter-
rors usually begin during the first third of the major sleep episode and last 1–10 minutes,
but they may last considerably longer, partic ularly in children. The episodes are accom-
panied by impressive autonomic arousal and behavioral manifestations of intense fear",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,445
"During an episode, the individual is difficult to  awaken or comfort. If the individual awak-
ens after the sleep terror, little or none of th e dream, or only fragmentary, single images,
are recalled. During a typical episode of sleep terrors, the individual abruptly sits up in
bed screaming or crying, with a frightened ex pression and autonomic signs of intense anx-
iety (e.g., tachycardia,  rapid breathing, sweating, dilati on of the pupils). The individual
may be inconsolable and is usually unresponsive to the efforts of others to awaken or com-
fort him or her. Slee p terrors are also called “night terrors” or “pavor nocturnus.”
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Sleepwalking episodes can include a wide va riety of behaviors. Episodes may begin with
confusion: the individual may simply sit up in  bed, look about, or pick at the blanket or
sheet. This behavior then becomes progress ively complex. The in dividual may actually
leave the bed and walk into closets, out of th e room, and even out of buildings. Individuals
may use the bathroom, eat, talk, or engage in  more complex behaviors. Running and fran-
tic attempts to escape some apparent threat can also occur. Most behaviors during sleep-
walking episodes are routine and of low complexity. However, cases of unlocking doors
and even operating machinery (driving an au tomobile) have been reported. Sleepwalking
can also include inappropriate behavior (e.g.,  commonly, urinating in a closet or waste-
basket). Most episodes l ast for several minutes to a half hour but may be more protracted",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,445

walking may not be appreciated until awakening after the fact",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,445
"There are two “specialized” fo rms of sleepwalking: sleep-related eating behavior and

experience unwanted recurrent episodes of eating with varying degrees of amnesia, rang-
ing from no awareness to full awareness with out the ability to not eat. During these epi-
sodes, inappropriate foods may be ingested. In dividuals with sleep-re lated eating disorder

behaviors arising from sleep wi thout conscious awareness. Th is condition is more common
in males and may result in serious interper sonal relationship problems or medicolegal
consequences",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,446
"During a typical episode of sleep terrors, th ere is often a sense of overwhelming dread,
with a compulsion to escape. Although fragmentary vivid dream images may occur, a story-
like dream sequence (as in nightmares) is not reported. Most commonly,  the individual does
not awaken fully, but returns to sleep and has amnesia for the episode on awakening the next
morning. Usually only one episode will occur on any one night. Occasionally several episodes
may occur at intervals throughout the night. Th ese events rarely arise during daytime naps. 
Prevalence
Isolated or infrequent NREM sleep arousal disorders are ve ry common in the general pop-
ulation. From 10% to 30% of children have had at least one episode of sleepwalking, and
2%–3% sleepwalk often. The prevalence of slee pwalking disorder, marked by repeated ep-
isodes and impairment or dist ress, is much lower, probably  in the range of 1%–5%. The
prevalence of sleepwalking episodes (not sleepwalking disorder) is 1.0%–7.0% among
adults, with weekly to monthly episodes o ccurring in 0.5%–0.7%. The lifetime prevalence
of sleepwalking in adults is 29.2%, with a p ast-year prevalence of sleepwalking of 3.6%",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,446
"The prevalence of sleep terrors in the general population is unknown. The prevalence
of sleep terror episodes (as op posed to sleep terror disorder, in which there is recurrence
and distress or impairment) is approximately 36.9 % at 18 months of age, 19.7% at 30 months
of age, and 2.2% in adults. 
Development and Course
NREM sleep arousal disorders occur most co mmonly in childhood and diminish in fre-
quency with increasing age. The onset of sl eepwalking in adults with no prior history of
sleepwalking as children should prompt a search for specific etiologies, such as obstruc-
tive sleep apnea, nocturnal seiz ures, or effect of medication. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Environmental. Sedative use, sleep deprivation, sl eep-wake schedule disruptions, fa-
tigue, and physical or emotional stress increa se the likelihood of ep isodes. Fever and sleep
deprivation can produce an increased freq uency of NREM sleep arousal disorders. 
Genetic and physiological. A family history for sleepwalking or sleep terrors may oc-
cur in up to 80% of individuals who sleepwal k. The risk for sleepwalking is further in-
creased (to as much as 60% of offspring) when both parents have a history of the disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,446

"402 Sleep-Wake Disorders
Diagnostic Markers
NREM sleep arousal disorders arise from an y stage of NREM sleep but most commonly
from deep NREM sleep (slow-wave sleep). They are most likely to appear in the first third
of the night and do not commonly occur duri ng daytime naps. During the episode, the
polysomnogram may be obscured with movement artifact. In the absence of such artifact,
the electroencephalogram typically shows theta or alpha frequency activity during the ep-
isode, indicating partial or incomplete arousal. 
Polysomnography in conjunctio n with audiovisual monitoring  can be used to document
episodes of sleepwalking. In the absence of ac tually capturing an event during a polysomno-
graphic recording, there are no polysomnogra phic features that can serve as a marker for
sleepwalking. Sleep deprivation may increase the likelihood of capturing an event. As a group,
individuals who sleepwalk show instability of de ep NREM sleep, but th e overlap in findings
with individuals who do not sleepwalk is great en ough to preclude use of this indicator in es-
tablishing a diagnosis. Unlike arousals from RE M sleep associated with nightmares, in which
there is an increase in heart rate and respiratio n prior to the arousal, the NREM sleep arousals
of sleep terrors begin precipitou sly from sleep, without anticipatory autonomic changes. The
arousals are associated with impressive autono mic activity, with doubling or tripling of
the heart rate. The pathophysiology is poorly unde rstood, but there appears to be instability in
the deeper stages of NREM sleep. Absent capturing an event during a formal sleep study,
there are no reliable polysomnographic indicators  of the tendency to experience sleep terrors",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,447
"Functional Consequences of 
Non-REM Sleep Arousal Disorders
For the diagnosis of a NREM sl eep arousal disorder to be ma de, the individual or house-
hold members must experience clinically signi ficant distress or impairment, although pa-
rasomnia symptoms may occur occasionally in nonclinical populations and would be
subthreshold for the diagnosis. Embarrassment concerning the episodes can impair social
relationships. Social isolation or occupational difficulties ca n result. The determination of a
“disorder” depends on a number  of factors, which may vary on an individual basis and
will depend on the frequency of  events, potential for violence  or injurious behaviors, em-
barrassment, or disruption/distr ess of other household member s. Severity determination
is best made based on the nature or consequenc e of the behaviors rather  than simply on fre-
quency. Uncommonly, NREM sleep arousal disorders may result in serious injury to the
individual or to someone trying  to console the individual. Inju ries to others are confined to
those in close proximity; individuals are not “sought out.” Typically, sleepwalking in both
children and adults is not associated with si gnificant mental disorders. For individuals
with sleep-related eating behaviors, unknowingly preparing or eati ng food during the
sleep period may create problems  such as poor diabetes control, weight gain, injury (cuts
and burns), or consequences of  eating dangerous or toxic in edibles. NREM sleep arousal
disorders may rarely result in violent or injurious behaviors with forensic implications",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,447

typically focuses on attempts to avoid or cope with immi nent danger but may involve
themes that evoke other negative emotions. Nightmares occurring after traumatic experi-
ences may replicate the threatening situation (“replicative nightmares”), but most do not",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,449

out sleep but are more likely in the second half of the major sleep episode when dreaming
is longer and more intense. Factors that incr ease early-night REM intensity, such as sleep
fragmentation or deprivation, jet lag, and REM-sensitive medications, might facilitate
nightmares earlier in the night, including at sleep onset",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,450
"Nightmares usually terminate with awakening and rapid return of full alertness. How-
ever, the dysphoric emotions may persist into wakefulness and contribute to difficulty re-
turning to sleep and lasting daytime distress . Some nightmares, known as “bad dreams,”
may not induce awakening and are recalled only later. If nightmare s occur during sleep-
onset REM periods ( hypnagogic ), the dysphoric emotion is frequently accompanied by a
sense of being both awake and unable to move voluntarily ( isolated sleep paralysis ). 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Mild autonomic arousal, including sweating, tachycardia, and tachypnea, may character-
ize nightmares. Body movements and vocalizations are not characteristic because of REM
sleep–related loss of skeletal  muscle tone, but such behavi ors may occur under situations
of emotional stress or sleep fragmentation and in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,450

Individuals with frequent nightmares are at substantially greater r isk for suicidal ide-
ation and suicide attempts, even when gender  and mental illness are taken into account. 
Prevalence
Prevalence of nightmares in creases through childhood into adolescence. From 1.3% to
3.9% of parents report that their preschool children have nightmares “often” or “always”",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,450
"Prevalence increases from ages 10 to 13 for both males and females but continues to in-
crease to ages 20–29 for females (while decreasing for males), when it can be twice as high
for females as for males. Prevalen ce decreases steadily with age for both sexes, but the gen-
der difference remains. Among adults, prevalen ce of nightmares at least monthly is 6%,
whereas prevalence for frequent nightmare s is 1%–2%. Estimates often combine idio-
pathic and posttraumatic nightmares indiscriminately",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,450
"Development and Course
Nightmares often begin between ages 3 and 6 years but reach a peak prevalence and se-
verity in late adolescence or  early adulthood. Nigh tmares most likely appear in children
exposed to acute or chronic psychosocial stressors and thus may not resolve spontane-
ously. In a minority, frequent nightmares pers ist into adulthood, becoming virtually a life-
long disturbance. Although specific nightm are content may reflect the individual’s age,
the essential features of the diso rder are the same across age groups. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Individuals who experience nightmares  report more frequent past ad-
verse events, but not necessarily trauma, an d often display personality disturbances or
psychiatric diagnosis. 
Environmental. Sleep deprivation or fragmentation, and irregular sleep-wake schedules
that alter the timing, intensity,  or quantity of REM sleep, can put individuals at risk for
nightmares",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,450
"Genetic and physiological. Twin studies have identified genetic effects on the disposi-
tion to nightmares and their co-occurrence with other parasomnias (e.g., sleeptalking). 
Course modifiers. Adaptive parental bedside behaviors, such as soothing the child fol-
lowing nightmares, may protect agai nst developing chronic nightmares. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,450

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
The significance attributed to nightmares may va ry by culture, and sensitivity to such be-
liefs may facilitate disclosure",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,451
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Adult females report having ni ghtmares more frequently th an do adult males. Nightmare
content differs by sex, with adult females tend ing to report themes of sexual harassment or
of loved ones disappearing/dying, and adult males tending to report themes of physical
aggression or war/terror. 
Diagnostic Markers
Polysomnographic studies demonstrate abrupt awakenings from REM sleep, usually during
the second half of the night, prior to report of a nightmare. Heart, respiratory, and eye move-
ment rates may quicken or increase in variab ility before awakening.  Nightmares following
traumatic events may also arise during non-REM (NREM), particularly stage 2, sleep. The typ-
ical sleep of individuals with nightmares is mild ly impaired (e.g., redu ced efficiency, less slow-
wave sleep, more awakenings), with more frequent periodic leg movements in sleep and rel-
ative sympathetic nervous system activation after REM sleep deprivation. 
Functional Consequences  of Nightmare Disorder
Nightmares cause more significant subjective distress than demonstrable social or occu-
pational impairment. However, if awakenings are frequent or result in sleep avoidance,
individuals may experience excessive daytime sleepiness, poor concentration, depression,
anxiety, or irritability. Freque nt childhood nightmares (e.g.,  several per week), may cause
significant distress to parents and child",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,451
"Differential Diagnosis
Sleep terror disorder. Both nightmare disorder and sleep  terror disorder include awak-
enings or partial awakenings with fearfuln ess and autonomic activation, but the two dis-
orders are differentiable. Nightmares typically occur later in the night, during REM sleep,
and produce vivid, storylike, and clearly re called dreams; mild autonomic arousal; and
complete awakenings. Sleep terrors typically arise in the first third of the night during
stage 3 or 4 NREM sleep and produce either no dream recall or images without an elabo-
rate storylike quality. The terr ors lead to partial awakenings that leave the individual con-
fused, disoriented, and only partially resp onsive and with substantial autonomic arousal",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,451
"There is usually amnesia for the event in the morning. 
REM sleep behavior disorder. The presence of complex motor activity during fright-
ening dreams should prompt further evaluation for REM sleep behavior disorder, which
occurs more typically among late middle-age  males and, unlike nightmare disorder, is as-
sociated with often violent dream enactment s and a history of nocturnal injuries. The
dream disturbance of REM sleep behavior diso rder is described by patients as nightmares
but is controlled by appropriate medication. 
Bereavement. Dysphoric dreams may occur during bereavement but typically involve
loss and sadness and are followed by self-refle ction and insight, rather than distress, on
awakening. 
Narcolepsy. Nightmares are a frequent complaint in  narcolepsy, but the presence of ex-
cessive sleepiness and cataplexy differentiates  this condition from  nightmare disorder.

are similar to panic attacks arising during wakefulness.

tional trauma as a “dream” during elec troencephalography-documented awakenings",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,452
"Medication or substance use. Numerous substances/medicat ions can precipitate night-
mares, including dopaminergics; beta-adrener gic antagonists and other antihypertensives;
amphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulants; antidepressants; smoking cessation aids;
and melatonin. Withdrawal of REM sleep–su ppressant medications (e.g., antidepressants)
and alcohol can produce REM sleep rebound accompanied by nightmares. If nightmares
are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of substance/
medication-induced sleep disorder should be considered. 
Comorbidity
Nightmares may be comorbid with several medical conditions, including coronary heart
disease, cancer, parkinsonism, and pain, and ca n accompany medical treatments, such as he-
modialysis, or withdrawal from medications or  substances of abuse. Nightmares frequently
are comorbid with other mental disorders, in cluding PTSD; insomnia disorder; schizophrenia;
psychosis; mood, anxiety, adjustment, and personality disorders; and grief during be-
reavement. A concurrent nightmare disorder diagnosis should only be considered when in-
dependent clinical attention is warranted (i.e., Criteria A–C are met). Otherwise, no separate
diagnosis is necessary. These conditions should be listed under the appropriate comorbid
category specifier. However, nightmare disorder  may be diagnosed as a separate disorder in
individuals with PTSD if the nightmares are temporally unrelated to PTSD (i.e., preceding
other PTSD symptoms or persisting after other PTSD symptoms have resolved)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,452
"Nightmares are normally characteristic of REM sleep behavior disorder, PTSD, and acute
stress disorder, but nightmare di sorder may be independently coded if nightmares preceded
the condition and their frequency or severity necessitates independent clinical attention. The

other disorder and whether they continued after other symptoms had remitted.

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is repeated
episodes of arousal, often associated with vo calizations and/or complex motor behaviors
arising from REM sleep (Criterion A). These be haviors often reflect motor responses to the
content of action-filled or violent dreams of being attacked or trying to escape from a
threatening situation, which may be termed dream enacting behaviors. The vocalizations are
often loud, emotion-fill ed, and profane. These behaviors may be very bothersome to the
individual and the bed partner and may result in significant injury (e.g., falling, jumping,
or flying out of bed; running, punching, thru sting, hitting, or kicking). Upon awakening,
the individual is immediately awake, alert, and oriented (Criterion C) and is often able to
recall dream mentation, which closely correlates with the observed behavior. The eyes
typically remain closed during these events. The diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disor-
der requires clinically significant distress or  impairment (Criterion  E); this determination
will depend on a number of factors, including the frequency of events, the potential for vi-
olence or injurious behaviors, embarrassment , and distress in othe r household members. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Severity determination is best made based on  the nature or conseq uence of the behavior
rather than simply on frequency. Although the behaviors are typically prominent and vi-
olent, lesser behaviors may also occur. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of REM sleep behavior disord er is approximately 0.38%–0.5% in the gen-
eral population. Prevalence in patients with psychiatric disorders may be greater, possibly
related to medications prescribed for the psychiatric disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,453
"Development and Course
The onset of REM sleep behavior disorder may be gradual or rapid, and the course is usu-
ally progressive. REM sleep behavior disorder associated with neurodegenerative disor-
ders may improve as the unde rlying neurodegenerative disorder progresses. Because of
the very high association with the later appe arance of an underlyi ng neurodegenerative
disorder, most notably one of the synucleino pathies (Parkinson’s disease, multiple system
atrophy, or major or mild neurocognitive di sorder with Lewy bodies), the neurological
status of individuals with REM sleep behavior disorder should be closely monitored",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,453

Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Genetic and physiological. Many widely prescribed medications, including tricyclic
antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reup-
take inhibitors, and beta-blockers, may resu lt in polysomnographic evidence of REM sleep

predisposition",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,454
"Diagnostic Markers
Associated laboratory findin gs from polysomnography indicate increased tonic and/or
phasic electromyographic activi ty during REM sleep that is normally associated with mus-
cle atonia. The increased muscle activity variably affects different muscle groups, mandating
more extensive electromyographi c monitoring than is employed in conventional sleep stud-
ies. For this reason, it is su ggested that electrom yographic monitoring include the submen-
talis, bilateral extensor digito rum, and bilateral anterior tibi alis muscle groups. Continuous
video monitoring is mandator y. Other polysomnographic findings may include very fre-
quent periodic and aperiodic extremity el ectromyography acti vity during non-REM
(NREM) sleep. This polysomnography observation, termed REM sleep without atonia,  is pres-
ent in virtually all cases of REM sleep behavi or disorder but may also be an asymptomatic
polysomnographic finding. Clinical dream-enacting behaviors coupled with the polysom-
nographic finding of REM without atonia is necessary for the diagnosis of REM sleep behav-
ior disorder. REM sleep without atonia with out a clinical history of dream-enacting
behaviors is simply an asymptomatic polyso mnographic observation. It is not known
whether isolated REM sleep without atonia is a precursor to REM sleep behavior disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,454

Other parasomnias. Confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors can easily be
confused with REM sleep behavior disorder. In  general, these disorders occur in younger

sional arousal is associated with confusion, disorientation, and incomplete recall of dream

Diagnostic Features
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is  a sensorimotor, neurological sleep disorder characterized
by a desire to move the legs or arms, usua lly associated with uncomfortable sensations
typically described as creeping, crawling, tingling, burning, or itch ing (Criterion A). The
diagnosis of RLS is based primarily on patient self-report and history. Symptoms are
worse when the individual is at rest, and freq uent movements of the legs occur in an effort
to relieve the uncomfortable sensations. Sympto ms are worse in the evening or night, and
in some individuals they occur only in the ev ening or night. Evening worsening occurs in-
dependently of any differences in activity. It is important to differentiate RLS from other
conditions such as positional discom fort and leg cramps (Criterion D)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,456
"The symptoms of RLS can delay sleep onset and awaken the individual from sleep and
are associated with significant sleep fragmentation. The relief obtained from moving the
legs may no longer be apparent in severe ca ses. RLS is associated with daytime sleepiness
and is frequently accompanied by significant clinical distress or functional impairment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,456
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) can serve as corroborating ev idence for RLS, with
up to 90% of individuals di agnosed with RLS demonstratin g PLMS when recordings are
taken over multiple nights. Periodic leg mo vements during wakefulness are supportive of
an RLS diagnosis. Reports of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep and of excessive
daytime sleepiness may also support the diagnosis of RLS. Additional supportive features
include a family history of RLS among first- degree relatives and a reduction in symptoms,
at least initially, with dopaminergic treatment. 
Prevalence 
Prevalence rates of RLS vary widely when br oad criteria are utilized but range from 2% to
7.2% when more defined criteria are employed . When frequency of symptoms is at least
three times per week with moderate or severe distress, the prevalence rate is 1.6%; when
frequency of symptoms is a minimum of one ti me per week, the prevalence rate is 4.5%",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,456

Development and Course
The onset of RLS typically occurs in the seco nd or third decade. Approximately 40% of in-

clinical course of RLS differs by age at onset.  When onset occurs before age 45, there is of-
ten a slow progression of symptoms. In late-onset RLS, rapid progression is typical, and
aggravating factors are common. Symptoms of RLS appear similar acro ss the lifespan, re-
maining stable or decreasing slightly in older age groups",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,456

equate descriptors of RLS. However, children rarely use or understand the word “urge,”
reporting instead that their legs “have to” or  “got to” move. Also, potentially related to
prolonged periods of sitting during class, tw o-thirds of children and adolescents report

"Nocturnal worsening tends to persist even in the context of pediatric RLS. As with RLS in
adults, there is a significant negative impact on sleep, mood, cognition, and function. Im-
pairment in children and adolescents is mani fested more often in behavioral and educa-
tional domains. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Genetic and physiological. Predisposing factors includ e female gender, advancing
age, genetic risk variants, an d family history of RLS. Precipitating factors are often time-
limited, such as iron defici ency, with most individuals resuming normal sleep patterns
after the initial triggering even t has disappeared. Genetic risk variants also play a role in
RLS secondary to such disorder s as uremia, suggesting that individuals with a genetic sus-
ceptibility develop RLS in the presence of further risk factors. RLS has a strong familial
component. 
There are defined pathophysi ological pathways subserving RLS. Genome-wide asso-
ciation studies have found that RLS is significantly associated with common genetic vari-
ants in intronic or intergenic regions in MEIS1 , BTBD9 , and MAP2K5  on chromosomes 2p,
6p, and 15q, respectively. The ass ociation of these three varian ts with RLS has been inde-
pendently replicated. BTBD9  confers a very large (80%) exce ssive risk when even a single
allele is present. Because of the high frequenc y of this variant in individuals of European
descent, the population attributable risk (P AR) approximates 50%. At-risk alleles associ-
ated with MEIS1  and BTBD9  are less common in individuals of African or Asian descent,
perhaps suggesting lower risk fo r RLS in these populations. 
Pathophysiological mechanisms in RLS also in clude disturbances in the central dopa-
minergic system and disturbances in iron  metabolism. The endo genous opiate system
may also be involved. Treatment effect s of dopaminergic drugs (primarily D2 and D3 non-
ergot agonists) provide further support that  RLS is grounded in dysfunctional central
dopaminergic pathways. While the effective treatment of RLS has also been shown to sig-
nificantly reduce depressive symptoms, seroto nergic antidepressants can induce or aggra-
vate RLS in some individuals. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Although RLS is more prevalent in females than  in males, there are no diagnostic differ-
ences according to gender. However, the prev alence of RLS during pregnancy is two to
three times greater than in the general population. RLS associated with pregnancy peaks
during the third trimester and improves or reso lves in most cases soon after delivery. The
gender difference in prevalence of RLS is explai ned at least in part by parity, with nullipa-
rous females being at the same r isk of RLS as age-matched males",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,457
"Diagnostic Markers
Polysomnography demonstrates  significant abnormalities in RLS, commonly increased
latency to sleep, and higher arousal index.  Polysomnography with a preceding immobili-
zation test may provide an indicator of the motor sign of RLS, periodic limb movements,
under standard conditions of sleep and during quiet resting, both of which can provoke RLS

a negative impact on mood, and 47.6% reporting a lack of energy. The most common conse-
quences of RLS are sleep disturbance, includ ing reduced sleep time , sleep fragmentation,
and overall disturbance; depression, generalize d anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and post-
traumatic stress disorder; and quality-of-life impairments. RLS can result in daytime sleep-
iness or fatigue and is frequently accompanied by significant distress or impairment in
affective, social, occupational, educational, academic, behavioral, or cognitive functioning. 
Differential Diagnosis 
The most important conditions in the differential diagnosis of RLS are leg cramps, posi-
tional discomfort, arthralgias/arthritis, myalgias, positional ischemia (numbness), leg
edema, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy,  and habitual foot tapping. “Knotting” of
the muscle (cramps), relief with a single postural shift, limitation to joints, soreness to pal-
pation (myalgias), and other abnormalities on physical exam ination are not characteristic
of RLS. Unlike RLS, nocturnal leg cramps do not typically present with the desire to move
the limbs nor are there frequent limb movements.  Less common conditions to be differen-
tiated from RLS include neuroleptic-induced akathisia, myelopathy, symptomatic venous
insufficiency, peripheral artery disease, ec zema, other orthopedic problems, and anxiety-
induced restlessness. Worsening at night an d periodic limb movements are more common
in RLS than in medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy. 
While is it important that RLS symptoms not be solely accounted for by another medical
or behavioral condition, it should also be appreciated that any of thes e similar conditions can
occur in an individual with RLS. This necessi tates a separate focus on each possible condi-
tion in the diagnostic process and when assessing impact. For cases in which the diagnosis of
RLS is not certain, evaluation for the supportive features of RLS, particularly PLMS or a fam-
ily history of RLS, may be helpful. Clinical features, such as response to a dopaminergic
agent and positive family history for RLS,  can help with the differential diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,458

code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for
the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-
stance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should
record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced sleep disorder (e.g.,
“mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induc ed sleep disorder”). If a moderate or severe
substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th po-
sition character is “2,” and the clinician shoul d record “moderate [substance] use disorder”
or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance
use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy
use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record
only the substance-induced sleep disorder. A m oderate or severe tobacco use disorder is
required in order to code a tobacco-induced sleep disorder; it is not permissible to code a
comorbid mild tobacco use disorder or no tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced
sleep disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,459

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of substance/medication -induced sleep disorder is a prominent sleep
disturbance that is suffi ciently severe to warrant independen t clinical attent ion (Criterion A)
and that is judged to be primarily associated with the pharmacological effects of a substance
(i.e., a drug of abuse, a medication, toxin ex posure) (Criterion B). Depending on the sub-
stance involved, one of four types of sleep di sturbances is reported. Insomnia type and day-
time sleepiness type are most common, while parasomnia type is seen less often. The mixed
type is noted when more than one type of sl eep disturbance–related symptom is present and
none predominates. The disturbance must not be better explained by another sleep disorder
(Criterion C). A substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is distinguished from insom-
nia disorder or a disorder associated with excessive daytime sleepines s by considering onset
and course. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence of intoxication or withdrawal from
the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. Substance/medication-induced
sleep disorder arises only in association wi th intoxication or di scontinuation/withdrawal
states, whereas other sleep disorders may preced e the onset of substance use or occur during
times of sustained abstinence. As discontinuation/withdrawal states for some substances
can be protracted, onset of th e sleep disturbance can occur 4 weeks after cessation of sub-
stance use, and the disturbance may have feat ures atypical of other sleep disorders (e.g.,
atypical age at onset or course). The diagnosi s is not made if the sleep disturbance occurs
only during a delirium (Criterion D). The symptoms must cause clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Crite-
rion E). This diagnosis should be made instea d of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or
substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical
picture and when the symptoms warrant  independent clinical attention. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
During periods of substance/medication use, intoxication, or withdrawal, individuals fre-
quently complain of dysphoric mood, includin g depression and anxiety, irritability, cog-
nitive impairment, inability to concentrate, and fatigue. 
Prominent and severe sleep disturbances can occur in association with intoxication
with the following classes of substances: alco hol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives,

stances. Prominent and severe sleep disturbances can occur in association with withdrawal
from the following classes of substances: alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives,

"Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder 417
Alcohol. Alcohol-induced sleep disorder typica lly occurs as insomnia type. During
acute intoxication, alcohol produces an immedi ate sedative effect depending on dose, ac-
companied by increased stages 3 and 4 non– rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and re-
duced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Following these initial e ffects, there may be
increased wakefulness, restless sleep, and vivid and anxiety-laden dreams for the remain-
ing sleep period. In parallel, stages 3 and 4 sleep are reduced, and wakefulness and REM
sleep are increased. Alcohol can aggravate br eathing-related sleep disorder. With habitual
use, alcohol continues to show a short-lived sedati ve effect in the first half of the night, fol-
lowed by sleep continuity disruption in the second half. During alcohol withdrawal, there
is extremely disrupted sleep continuity, and an increased amount and intensity of REM
sleep, associated frequently with vivid drea ming, which in extreme form, constitutes part
of alcohol withdrawal delirium. After acut e withdrawal, chronic alcohol users may con-
tinue to complain of light, fragmented sleep for weeks to years associated with a persistent
deficit in slow-wave sleep",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,462
"Caffeine. Caffeine-induced sleep disorder produces insomnia in a dose-dependent man-
ner, with some individuals presenting with  daytime sleepiness related to withdrawal. 
Cannabis. Acute administration of cannabis may shorten sleep latency, though arous-
ing effects with increments in sleep latenc y also occur. Cannabis enhances slow-wave
sleep and suppresses REM sleep after acute administration. In chronic users, tolerance to
the sleep-inducing and slow-wave sleep–enha ncing effects develops. Upon withdrawal,
sleep difficulties and unpleasant dreams have  been reported lasting for several weeks",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,462
"Polysomnography studies demonstrate reduced slow-wave sleep and increased REM sleep
during this phase",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,462
"Opioids. Opioids may produce an increase in sleepiness and in subjective depth of sleep,
and reduced REM sleep, during acute short-te rm use. With continued administration, tol-
erance to the sedative effects of opioids de velops and there are co mplaints of insomnia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,462
"Consistent with their respiratory depressant  effects, opioids exacerbate sleep apnea",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,462
"Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances. Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics (e.g.,
barbiturates, benzodiazepines receptor agon ists, meprobamate, glutethimide, methypry-
lon) have similar effects as opioids on sleep. During acute intoxication, sedative-hypnotic
drugs produce the expected incr ease in sleepiness and decrea se in wakefulness. Chronic
use (particularly of barbiturates and the ol der nonbarbiturate, no nbenzodiazepine drugs)
may cause tolerance with subsequent return  of insomnia. Daytime sleepiness may occur",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,462
"Sedative-hypnotic drugs can increase the frequency and severity of obstructive sleep ap-
nea events. Parasomnias are associated with us e of benzodiazepine receptor agonists, es-
pecially when these medications are taken at  higher doses and when they are combined
with other sedative drugs. Ab rupt discontinuation of chronic sedative, hypnotic, or anx-
iolytic use can lead to withdrawal but mo re commonly rebound insomnia, a condition of
an exacerbation of insomnia upon drug disc ontinuation for 1–2 days reported to occur
even with short-term use. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs with short durations of
action are most likely to produce complain ts of rebound insomnia, whereas those with
longer durations of action are more often asso ciated with daytime sl eepiness. Any sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic drug can potentiall y cause daytime sedation, withdrawal, or re-
bound insomnia. 
Amphetamines and related substances and other stimulants. Sleep disorders induced
by amphetamine and related substances and other stimulants are characterized by insomnia
during intoxication and excessi ve sleepiness during withdrawal. During acute intoxication,
stimulants reduce the total amount of sleep, incr ease sleep latency and sleep continuity distur-
bances, and decrease REM sleep. Slow-wave slee p tends to  be reduced. During withdrawal
from chronic stimulant use, there is both pr olonged nocturnal sleep duration and excessive
daytime sleepiness. Multiple sleep latency te sts may show increased daytime sleepiness dur-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,462

sion, and sleep disturbances, even  during longer-term abstinence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,463
"Tobacco. Chronic tobacco consumption is associat ed primarily with symptoms of insom-
nia, decreased slow-wave sleep with a reductio n of sleep efficiency, and increased daytime
sleepiness. Withdrawal from tobacco can lead  to impaired sleep. Individuals who smoke
heavily may experience regular nocturnal awakenings caused by tobacco craving",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,463
"Other or unknown substances/medications. Other substances/medications may pro-
duce sleep disturbances, particularly medications that affect the central or autonomic
nervous systems (e.g., adrenergic agonists an d antagonists, dopamine agonists and antag-
onists, cholinergic agonists an d antagonists, serotonergic agonists and antagonists, anti-
histamines, corticosteroids). 
Development and Course
Insomnia in children can be identified by eith er a parent or the child. Often the child has a
clear sleep disturbance associated with initiation of a medication but may not report
symptoms, although parents observe the slee p disturbances. The use of some illicit sub-
stances (e.g., cannabis, ecstasy) is prevalen t in adolescence and early adulthood. Insomnia
or any other sleep disturbance encountered in  this age group should  prompt careful con-
sideration of whether the sleep disturbance is due to consumption of these substances",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,463
"Help-seeking behavior for the sleep disturbance in these age groups is limited, and thus
corroborative report may be elic ited from a parent, caregiver, or teacher. Older individuals
take more medications and are at increased risk for developing a substance/medication-
induced sleep disorder. They may interpret sleep  disturbance as part of normal aging and
fail to report symptoms. Individuals with ma jor neurocognitive disorder (e.g., dementia)
are at risk for substance/me dication-induced sleep disord ers but may not report symp-
toms, making corroborative report from  caregiver(s) particularly important",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,463
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Risk and prognostic factors involved in subs tance abuse/dependence  or medication use
are normative for certain age groups. They are relevant for, and likely applicable to, the
type of sleep disturbance encountered (see th e chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive
Disorders” for descriptions of resp ective substance use disorders)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,463
"Temperamental. Substance use generally precipitates or accompanies insomnia in vul-
nerable individuals. Thus, presence of insomnia in response to stress or change in sleep en-
vironment or timing can represent a risk for developing substance/medication-induced
sleep disorder. A similar risk may be present for individuals with other sleep disorders
(e.g., individuals with hypersomnia who use stimulants)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,463
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
The consumption of substances, including pres cribed medications, may depend in part on
cultural background and specif ic local drug regulations. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Gender-specific prevalences (i.e., females affected more than males at a ratio of about 2:1) exist
for patterns of consumption of some substances  (e.g., alcohol). The same amount and duration
of consumption of a given substance may lead to highly different sleep-related outcomes in
males and females based on, for example, gender -specific differences in hepatic functioning.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,463
"Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder 419
Diagnostic Markers
Each of the substance/medica tion-induced sleep disorders produces electroencephalo-
graphic sleep patterns that are as sociated with, but cannot be considered diagnostic of, other
disorders. The electroencephalo graphic sleep profile for each substance is related to the
stage of use, whether intake/intoxication, chronic use, or wi thdrawal following discontinu-
ation of the substance. All-night polysomnography can help define the severity of insomnia
complaints, while the multiple sleep latency test provides information about the severity of
daytime sleepiness. Monitoring of nocturnal respiration and periodic limb movements with
polysomnography may verify a substance’s im pact on nocturnal breathing and motor be-
havior. Sleep diaries for 2 weeks and actigraphy  are considered helpful in confirming the
presence of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Dr ug screening ca n be of use
when the individual is not aware or unwilling to relate information about substance intake",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,464
"Functional Consequences of 
Substance/Medication-I nduced Sleep Disorder
While there are many functional consequences  associated with sleep disorders, the only
unique consequence for substa nce/medication-induced sleep disorder is increased risk
for relapse. The degree of sleep disturbance during alcohol withdrawal (e.g., REM sleep
rebound predicts risk of relapse of drinking ). Monitoring of sleep quality and daytime
sleepiness during and after withdrawal may provide clinically meaningful information on
whether an individual is at increased risk for relapse",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,464
"Differential Diagnosis
Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal. Sleep disturbances are commonly en-
countered in the context of substance intoxi cation or substance discontinuation/with-
drawal. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder should be made
instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxicati on or substance withdrawal only when the
sleep disturbance is predominant in the clinic al picture and is suffi ciently severe to war-
rant independent clinical attention. 
Delirium. If the substance/medication-induced sl eep disturbance occurs exclusively dur-
ing the course of a delirium, it is not diagnosed separately. 
Other sleep disorders. A substance/medication-induced sl eep disorder is distinguished
from another sleep disorder if a substance/medication is judged to be etiologically related to
the symptoms. A su bstance/medication-induc ed sleep disorder attributed to a prescribed
medication for a mental disorder or medical co ndition must have its onset while the individual
is receiving the medication or during disconti nuation, if there is a discontinuation/with-
drawal syndrome associated with the medication. Once treatment is discontinued, the sleep
disturbance will usually remit within days to  several weeks. If symptoms persist beyond
4 weeks, other causes for the sleep disturbanc e–related symptoms should be considered. Not
infrequently, individuals with another sleep di sorder use medications or drugs of abuse to
self-medicate their symptoms (e.g., alcohol fo r management of insomn ia). If the substance/
medication is judged to play a significant role in the exacerbation of the sleep disturbance, an
additional diagnosis of a substance/medicati on-induced sleep disorder may be warranted. 
Sleep disorder due to an other medical condition. Substance/medication-induced sleep
disorder and sleep disorder associated with  another medical condition may produce sim-
ilar symptoms of insomnia, daytime sleepiness, or a parasomnia. Many individuals with
other medical conditions that  cause sleep disturbance are treated with medications that
may also cause sleep disturbances. The chrono logy of symptoms is the most important fac-
tor in distinguishing between th ese two sources of sleep symptoms. Difficulties with sleep
that clearly preceded the use of any medication for treatment of a medical condition would",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,464

suggest a diagnosis of sleep disorder associated with another medical condition. Con-
versely, sleep symptoms that appear only afte r the initiation of a particular medication/
substance suggest a substance/medication-ind uced sleep disorder. If the disturbance is
comorbid with another medical condition and is also exacerbated by substance use, both
diagnoses (i.e., sleep disorder associated with another medical condition and substance/
medication-induced sleep disorder) are given. When there is insuffici ent evidence to de-
termine whether the sleep distur bance is attributable to a substance/medication or to an-
other medical condition or is primary (i.e., not due to either a substance/medication or
another medical condition), a diagnosis of ot her specified sleep-wake disorder or unspec-

 Dysfunctions
Sexual dysfunctions  include delayed ejaculation, er ectile disorder, female orgasmic
disorder, female sexual intere st/arousal disorder, genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder,
male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, premature (early) ejac ulation, substance/medication-
induced sexual dysfunction, other specified se xual dysfunction, and unspecified sexual dys-
function. Sexual dysfunctions ar e a heterogeneous group of disorders that are typically char-
acterized by a clinically significant disturbance in a person’s ability to respond sexually or to
experience sexual pleasure. An individual may have several sexual dysfunctions at the same
time. In such cases, all of the dysfunctions should be diagnosed. 
Clinical judgment should be used to determin e if the sexual difficulties are the result of
inadequate sexual stimulation; in these cases,  there may still be a need for care, but a di-
agnosis of a sexual dysfunctio n would not be made. These cases may include, but are not
limited to, conditions in which lack of know ledge about effective stimulation prevents the
experience of arousal or orgasm",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,468

Sexual response has a requisite biological underpinning, yet is usually experienced in
an intrapersonal, interpersonal, and cultural context. Thus, sexual fu nction involves a com-
plex interaction among biological, sociocultural, and psychological factors. In many clinical
contexts, a precise understanding of the etiolo gy of a sexual problem is unknown. Nonethe-
less, a sexual dysfunction diagnosis requires ruling out problems that are better explained
by a nonsexual mental disorder, by the effects of a substance (e.g., drug or medication), by
a medical condition (e.g., due to  pelvic nerve damage), or by severe relationship distress,
partner violence, or other stressors.

thought to be better explained by the use/misuse  or discontinuation of a drug or substance, it
should be diagnosed accordingly as a substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction. If
the sexual dysfunction is attributable to anot her medical condition (e.g., peripheral neuropa-
thy), the individual would not receive a psychiatric diagnosis. If severe relationship distress,
partner violence, or significant stressors better ex plain the sexual difficulties, then a sexual dys-
function diagnosis is not made, but an appropriat e V or Z code for the relationship problem or
stressor may be listed. In many cases, a precise etiological relationship between another con-

"Diagnostic Features
The distinguishing feature of delayed ejaculation is a marked delay in or inability to
achieve ejaculation (Cri terion A). The man reports difficulty or inability to ejaculate de-
spite the presence of adequate sexual stimul ation and the desire to ejaculate. The present-
ing complaint usually involves partnered sexual  activity. In most cases, the diagnosis will
be made by self-report of the individual. The defini tion of “delay” does not have precise
boundaries, as there is noconsensus as to what  constitutes a reasonable time to reach or-
gasm or what is unacceptably long fo r most men and their sexual partners",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,469
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
The man and his partner may report prolonged thrusting to achieve or gasm to the point of
exhaustion or genital discomfo rt and then ceasing efforts. Some men may report avoiding",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,469

may report feeling less sexually attractive because their partner ca nnot ejaculate easily",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,470
"In addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acqu ired” and “generalized/situational,” the fol-
lowing five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of delayed ejacu-
lation, given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or  treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g.,
partner’s sexual pr oblems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor com-
munication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual  vulnerability factors
(e.g., poor body image; history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g.,
depression, anxiety), or stressor s (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors
(e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions agains t sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality);
and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each  of these factors may
contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different men with this disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,470
"Prevalence
Prevalence is unclear because of the lack of a precise definition of this syndrome. It is the
least common male sexual complaint. Only 75% of men report always ejaculating during
sexual activity, and less than 1% of men will complain of problems with reaching ejacula-
tion that last more than 6 months",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,470
"Development and Course
Lifelong delayed ejaculation begins with ea rly sexual experiences and continues through-
out life. By definition, acquired  delayed ejaculation begins after a period of normal sexual
function. There is minimal evidence concerni ng the course of acquired delayed ejacula-
tion. The prevalence of delaye d ejaculation appears to remain relatively constant until
around age 50 years, when the incidence begins  to increase significantly. Men in their 80s
report twice as much difficulty ejac ulating as men younger than 59 years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,470
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. Age-related loss of the fast-conducting peripheral sensory
nerves and age-related decreased sex steroid secretion may be associated with the increase
in delayed ejaculation in men older than 50 years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,470
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Complaints of ejaculatory delay vary across countries and cultures. Such complaints are
more common among men in Asian population s than in men living in Europe, Australia,
or the United States. This variation may be attributable to cultural or genetic differences
between cultures",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,470

activity). Another medical illness or injury ma y produce delays in ejaculation independent
of psychological issues. For example, inability to ejaculate can be caused by interruption of
the nerve supply to the genitals , such as can occur after traumatic surgical injury to the
lumbar sympathetic ganglia, abdominoperitoneal surgery, or lumbar sympathectomy",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,471
"Ejaculation is thought to be under autonomic nervous system control involving the hypo-
gastric (sympathetic) and pudendal (parasym pathetic) nerves. A number of neurodegen-
erative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and diabetic and alcoholic neuropathy, can
cause inability to ejaculate. Delayed ejaculat ion should also be diffe rentiated from retro-
grade ejaculation (i.e., ejaculation into the bladder), which may follow transurethral pros-
tatic resection",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,471
"Substance/medication use. A number of pharmacological agents, such as antidepres-
sants, antipsychotics, alpha sympathetic drugs, and opioid drugs, can cause ejaculatory
problems",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,471
"Dysfunction with orgasm. It is important in the history to ascertain whether the com-
plaint concerns delayed ejaculation or the sensation of orgasm, or both. Ejaculation occurs
in the genitals, whereas the experience of orga sm is believed to be primarily subjective",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,471
"Ejaculation and orgasm usually occur together  but not always. For example, a man with a
normal ejaculatory pattern may complain of decreased pleasure (i.e., anhedonic ejacula-
tion). Such a complaint would not be coded as delayed ejaculation but could be coded as

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of erectile disorder is the repeated failure to obtain or maintain erec-
tions during partnered sexual activities (Crite rion A). A careful sexual history is necessary
to ascertain that the problem has been present for a significant duration of time (i.e., at least
approximately 6 months) and occurs on the majo rity of sexual occasions (i.e., at least 75%
of the time). Symptoms may occur only in sp ecific situations involving certain types of
stimulation or partners, or they may occur in  a generalized manner in all types of situa-
tions, stimulatio n, or partners. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Many men with erectile disorder may have lo w self-esteem, low self-c onfidence, and a de-
creased sense of masculinity, and may experience depressed affect. Fear and/or avoid-
ance of future sexual encounters may occu r. Decreased sexual satisfaction and reduced
sexual desire in the individual’s partner are common. 
In addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acqu ired” and “generalized/situational,” the fol-
lowing five factors must be considered during  assessment and diagnosis of erectile disorder
given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g., part-
ner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor communi-
cation, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) in dividual vulnerability factors (e.g.,
poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., de-
pression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g.,
inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and
5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, cour se, or treatment. Each of these factors may con-
tribute differently to the pr esenting symptoms of differe nt men with this disorder. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of lifelong vers us acquired erectile disorder  is unknown. There is a strong
age-related increase in both prevalence and incidence of problems with erection, particu-
larly after age 50 years. Approximately 13%–21%  of men ages 40–80 years complain of oc-
casional problems with erections. Approxim ately 2% of men younger than age 40–50 years
complain of frequent problems with erecti ons, whereas 40%–50% of men older than 60–70
years may have significant problems with erec tions. About 20% of me n fear erectile prob-
lems on their first sexual experience, wherea s approximately 8% experienced erectile prob-
lems that hindered penetration duri ng their first sexual experience",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,472
"Development and Course 
Erectile failure on first sexual attempt has been found to be related to having sex with a pre-
viously unknown partner, concomit ant use of drugs or alcohol, not wanting to have sex, and
peer pressure. There is minimal evidence rega rding the persistence of  such problems after
the first attempt. It is assumed that most of these problems spontane ously remit without pro-
fessional intervention, but some men may contin ue to have episodic problems. In contrast,
acquired erectile disorder is of ten associated with biological factors such as diabetes and car-
diovascular disease. Acquired er ectile disorder is likely to  be persistent in most men",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,472

erectile disorder is more likely to be related to biological factors and to be persistent. The

lege students, and submissive personality traits may be associated with erectile problems in
men age 40 years and older. Alexithymia  (i.e., deficits in cognitive processing of emotions) is

"Diagnostic Markers
Nocturnal penile tumescence testing and meas ured erectile turgidity during sleep can be
employed to help differentiate organic from  psychogenic erectile problems on the as-
sumption that adequate erections during ra pid eye movement sleep indicate a psycholog-
ical etiology to the problem. A number of other diagnostic procedures may be employed
depending on the clinician’s assessment of their relevance given the individual’s age, co-
morbid medical problems, and clinical pres entation. Doppler ultrasonography and intra-
vascular injection of vasoactive drugs, as we ll as invasive diagnostic procedures such as
dynamic infusion cavernosography, can be used to assess vascular integrity. Pudendal
nerve conduction studies, including somato sensory evoked potentials, can be employed
when a peripheral neuropathy is suspected. In men also complaining of decreased sexual
desire, serum bioavailable or free testosterone is frequently assessed to determine if the
difficulty is secondary to endocrinological factors. Thyroid function may also be assessed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,473

Substance/medication use. Another major differential diagnosis is whether the erectile

"Another medical condition. The most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis of erec-
tile disorder is ruling out erec tile problems that are fully explained by medical factors. Such
cases would not receive a diagnosis of a ment al disorder. The distinction between erectile
disorder as a mental disorder and erectile dy sfunction as the result of another medical con-
dition is usually unclear, and many cases will have complex, interactive biological and psy-
chiatric etiologies. If the individual is older than 40–50 years and/or has concomitant
medical problems, the differential diagnosis should include medical etiologies, especially
vascular disease. The presence of an organic disease known to  cause erectile problems does
not confirm a causal relationship. For exampl e, a man with diabetes mellitus can develop
erectile disorder in response to psychological stress. In general, erectile dysfunction due to

Female orgasmic disorder is characterize d by difficulty experiencing orgasm and/or
markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensat ions (Criterion A). Women show wide vari-
ability in the type or intensity of stimulation that elicits orgasm. Similarly, subjective descrip-
tions of orgasm are extremely varied, suggesti ng that it is experienced in very different
ways, both across women and on different occasions by the same woman. For a diagnosis
of female orgasmic disorder, symptoms must be experienced on almost all or all (approx-
imately 75%–100%) occasions of sexual activity  (in identified situational contexts or, if
generalized, in all contexts) and have a mi nimum duration of approximately 6 months",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,475

or a medical condition, then a diagnosis of fe male orgasmic disorder  would not be made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,475

of female orgasmic diso rder would not be made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,475
"Many women require clitoral stimulation to  reach orgasm, and a relatively small pro-
portion of women report that they always ex perience orgasm during penile-vaginal inter-
course. Thus, a woman’s experiencing orgasm through clitoral stim ulation but not during
intercourse does not meet criteria for a clinic al diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. It is
also important to consider whether orgasmic difficulties are the result of inadequate sex-
ual stimulation; in these cases, there may still be a need for care, but a diagnosis of female
orgasmic disorder would not be made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,475
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
Associations between specific patterns of personality traits  or psychopathology and orgas-
mic dysfunction have generally not been su pported. Compared with women without the
disorder, some women with female orgasmic disorder may have greater difficulty com-
municating about sexual issues. Overall sexual satisfaction, however, is not strongly cor-
related with orgasmic experien ce. Many women report high le vels of sexual satisfaction",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,475
"Female Orgasmic Disorder 431
despite rarely or never experiencing orgasm . Orgasmic difficulties in women often co-
occur with problems related to  sexual interest and arousal",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,476
"In addition to the subtypes “lifelong/acquired” and “generalized/situational,” the fol-
lowing five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of female orgas-
mic disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner
factors (e.g., partner’s sexual problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors
(e.g., poor communication, discre pancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vul-
nerability factors (e.g., poor body  image, history of sexual or  emotional abuse), psychiatric
comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or st ressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); (4) cul-
tural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions relate d to prohibitions against sexual activity;
attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical fact ors relevant to prognosis, course, or treat-
ment. Each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of dif-
ferent women with this disorder. 
Prevalence 
Reported prevalence rates for female orgasmic problems in women vary widely, from 10%
to 42%, depending on multiple factors (e.g., ag e, culture, duration, and severity of symp-
toms); however, these estimates do not take into account the presence of distress. Only a
proportion of women experiencing orgasm di fficulties also report associated distress",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,476
"Variation in how symptoms are assessed (e.g., the duration of symptoms and the recall pe-
riod) also influence prevalence rates. Approx imately 10% of women do not experience or-
gasm throughout their lifetime. 
Development and Course 
By definition, lifelong female orgasmic disorder indicates that the orgasmic difficulties have
always been present, whereas the acquired subtype would be assigned if the woman’s or-
gasmic difficulties developed after a pe riod of normal orgasmic functioning. 
A woman’s first experience of orgasm can occur any time from the prepubertal period
to well into adulthood. Women show a more variable pattern in age at first orgasm than do
men, and women’s reports of having experien ced orgasm increase with age. Many women
learn to experience orgasm as they experien ce a wide variety of stimulation and acquire
more knowledge about their bodies. Women’s rates of orgasm consistency (defined as
“usually or always” experiencing orgasm) are higher during masturbation than during
sexual activity with a partner. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. A wide range of psychological factors, such as anxiety and concerns
about pregnancy, can potentially interfere wi th a woman’s ability to experience orgasm",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,476
"Environmental. There is a strong association betw een relationship problems, physical
health, and mental health and orgasm difficulties in women. Sociocultural factors (e.g.,
gender role expectations and religious norms)  are also important influences on the expe-
rience of orgasmic difficulties",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,476
"Genetic and physiological. Many physiological factors may influence a woman’s expe-
rience of orgasm, including medical conditio ns and medications. Conditions such as mul-
tiple sclerosis, pelvic nerve da mage from radical hysterectomy, and spinal cord injury can
all influence orgasmic functioning in women. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are
known to delay or inhibit orgasm in women.  Women with vulvovaginal atrophy (charac-
terized by symptoms such as vaginal dryness, itching, and pain) are significantly more
likely to report orgasm difficulties than are women without this condition. Menopausal
status is not consistently associated with the likelihood of orgasm difficulties. There may
be a significant genetic contribution to vari ation in female orgasmic function. However,",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,476
"432 Sexual Dysfunctions
psychological, sociocultural, and physiological factors likely interact in complex ways to
influence women’s experience of orgasm and of orgasm difficulties. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
The degree to which lack of orgasm in women is regarded as a problem that requires treat-
ment may vary depending on cultural context. In addition, women differ in how important
orgasm is to their sexual satisfaction. Ther e may be marked sociocultural and generational
differences in women’s orgasmic ability. For example, the prevalence of inability to reach or-
gasm has ranged from 17.7% (in Northern  Europe) to 42.2% (i n Southeast Asia). 
Diagnostic Markers 
Although measurable physiological change s occur during female  orgasm, including
changes in hormones, pelvic floor musculature,  and brain activation, there is significant
variability in these indicators of orgasm across  women. In clinical situations, the diagnosis
of female orgasmic disorder is based on a woman’s self-report",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,477
"Functional Consequences of  Female Orgasmic Disorder 
The functional consequences of female orgasmic  disorder are unclear.  Although there is a
strong association between relationship proble ms and orgasmic difficulties in women, it is
unclear whether relationship factors are risk fa ctors for orgasmic difficulties or are conse-
quences of those difficulties",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,477
"Differential Diagnosis
Nonsexual mental disorders. Nonsexual mental disorders,  such as major depressive
disorder, which is characterized by markedly dimi nished interest or pleasure in all, or al-
most all, activities, may explain female orgasm ic disorder. If the orgasmic difficulties are
better explained by another me ntal disorder, then a diagnosis  of female orgasmic disorder
would not be made. 
Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction. Substance/medication use may
explain the orgasmic difficulties",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,477
"Another medical condition. If the disorder is due to an other medical condition (e.g.,
multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury), then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would
not be made. 
Interpersonal factors. If interpersonal or significant co ntextual factors, such as severe
relationship distress, intimate partner violen ce, or other significant stressors, are associ-
ated with the orgasmic difficulties, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would
not be made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,477
"Other sexual dysfunctions. Female orgasmic disorder may occur in association with other
sexual dysfunctions (e.g., female sexual intere st/arousal disorder). Th e presence of another
sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosi s of female orgasmic disorder. Occasional or-
gasmic difficulties that are short-term or infreq uent and are not accompanied by clinically sig-
nificant distress or impairment are not diagno sed as female orgasmic disorder. A diagnosis is
also not appropriate if the problems are the result of inadequate sexual stimulation. 
Comorbidity
Women with female orgasmic disorder may have co-occurring sexu al interest/arousal
difficulties. Women with diagnoses of other no nsexual mental disorder s, such as major de-
pressive disorder, may experience lower sexu al interest/arousal, and this may indirectly
increase the likelihood of  orgasmic difficulties.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,477

"Diagnostic Features 
In assessing female sexual interest/arousal di sorder, interpersonal co ntext must be taken
into account. A “desire discrepancy,” in whic h a woman has lower desire for sexual activ-

quency or intensity of at least three of six indicators (Criterion A) for a minimum duration

women, as well as variability in how sexual in terest and arousal are expressed. For exam-
ple, in one woman, sexual interest/arousal di sorder may be expressed as a lack of interest
in sexual activity, an absence of erotic or se xual thoughts, and reluct ance to initiate sexual
activity and respond to a partner’s sexual invi tations. In another woman, an inability to be-
come sexually excited, to resp ond to sexual stimuli with se xual desire, and a correspond-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,478

ing lack of signs of physical sexual arousa l may be the primary features. Because sexual
desire and arousal frequently coex ist and are elicited in respon se to adequate sexual cues,
the criteria for female sexual in terest/arousal disorder take into account that difficulties in
desire and arousal often simult aneously characterize the co mplaints of women with this
disorder. Short-term changes in  sexual interest or arousal are common and may be adaptive
responses to events in a woma n’s life and do not represent a sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis
of female sexual interest/arousal disorder requires a minimum duration of symptoms of
approximately 6 months as a reflection that the symptoms must be a persistent problem",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,479
"The estimation of persistence may be determin ed by clinical judgment when a duration of
6 months cannot be ascertained precisely",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,479
"There may be absent or reduced frequency or inte nsity of interest in se xual activity (Crite-
rion A1), which was previously termed hypoactive sexual desire disorder.  The frequency or inten-
sity of sexual and erotic thoughts or fantasie s may be absent or reduced (Criterion A2). The
expression of fantasies varies widely across women and may include memories of past sexual
experiences. The normative decline in sexual thoughts with age should be taken into account
when this criterion is being assessed. Absence or  reduced frequency of initiating sexual activ-
ity and of receptivity to a partner’s sexual invitations (Criterion A3) is a behaviorally focused
criterion. A couple’s beliefs and preferences for sexual initiation  patterns are highly relevant to
the assessment of this criterion. There may be ab sent or reduced sexual excitement or pleasure
during sexual activity in almos t all or all (approximately 75%– 100%) sexual encounters (Cri-
terion A4). Lack of pleasure is a common presenting clinical complaint in women with low de-
sire. Among women who report low sexual desire , there are fewer sexual or erotic cues that
elicit sexual interest or arousal (i.e., there is a lack of “responsive desire”). Assessment of the
adequacy of sexual stimuli will assist in determining if there is a difficulty with responsive sex-
ual desire (Criterion A5). Freque ncy or intensity of genital or nongenital sensations during sex-
ual activity may be reduced or absent (Crite rion A6). This may include reduced vaginal
lubrication/vasocongestion, but because physiological measures of genital sexual response do
not differentiate women who report  sexual arousal concerns from those who do not, the self-
report of reduced or absent genital or  nongenital sensations is sufficient. 
For a diagnosis of female sexual  interest/arousal disorder to  be made, clinically signif-
icant distress must accompany the symptoms in  Criterion A. Distress may be experienced
as a result of the lack of sexual interest/arousal or as a result of significant interference in
a woman’s life and well-being. If a lifelong lack of sexual desire is better explained by one’s
self-identification as “asexual,” then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disor-
der would not be made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,479
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
Female sexual interest/arousal disorder is fr equently associated with problems in experi-
encing orgasm, pain experienced during sexual  activity, infrequent sexual activity, and
couple-level discrepancies in desire. Relationship difficulties and mood disorders are also
frequently associated features of female sexual interest/arousal disorder. Unrealistic ex-
pectations and norms regarding the “appropriate” level of sexual intere st or arousal, along
with poor sexual techniques and lack of info rmation about sexuality,  may also be evident

"Prevalence 
The prevalence of female sexual interest/arousal disorder, as defined in this manual, is
unknown. The prevalence of low sexual desire and of problems with sexual arousal (with
and without associated distress), as defined by DSM-IV or ICD-10, may vary markedly in
relation to age, cultural setting, duration of symptoms, and presence of distress. Regard-
ing duration of symptoms, there are striking  differences in prevalence estimates between
short-term and persistent problems related to lack of sexual intere st. When distress about
sexual functioning is requir ed, prevalence estimates are markedly lower. Some older
women report less distress ab out low sexual desire than y ounger women, although sexual
desire may decrease with age. 
Development and Course 
By definition, lifelong female sexual interest /arousal disorder suggests that the lack of
sexual interest or arousal has been present fo r the woman’s entire sexual life. For Criteria
A3, A4, and A6, which assess functioning duri ng sexual activity, a subtype of lifelong
would mean presence of symptoms since the in dividual’s first sexual experiences. The ac-
quired subtype would be assigned if the difficu lties with sexual interest or arousal de-
veloped after a period of nonproblematic se xual functioning. Adaptive and normative
changes in sexual functioning may result from  partner-related, interpersonal, or personal
events and may be transient in nature. Howe ver, persistence of symptoms for approxi-
mately 6 months or more would constitute a sexual dysfunction",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,480
"There are normative changes in  sexual interest and arousal across the life span. Fur-
thermore, women in relationships of longer du ration are more likely to report engaging in
sex despite no obvious feelings of sexual desi re at the outset of a sexual encounter com-
pared with women in shorter-duration relationships. Vaginal dryness in older women is
related to age and menopausal status. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors

sexuality and past history of mental disorders. Differences in propensity for sexual excitation
and sexual inhibition may also predict the likelihood of developi ng sexual problems",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,480

"Diagnostic Features 
Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder refe rs to four commonly comorbid symptom di-
mensions: 1) difficulty having in tercourse, 2) genito-pelvic pain , 3) fear of pain or vaginal
penetration, and 4) tension of the pelvic fl oor muscles (Criterion A). Because major diffi-
culty in any one of these symptom dimensions is often sufficient to cause clinically sig-
nificant distress, a diagnosis can be made on the basis of marked difficulty in only one
symptom dimension. However, a ll four symptom dimensions should be assessed even if a
diagnosis can be made on the basis of only one symptom dimension. 
Marked difficulty having vaginal intercourse/penetration  (Criterion A1) can vary from a total in-
ability to experience vaginal penetration in an y situation (e.g., interc ourse, gynecological ex-
aminations, tampon insertion) to the ability to easily experience penetration in one situation
and but not in another. Although the most comm on clinical situation is when a woman is un-
able to experience intercourse or penetration with a partner, difficult ies in undergoing re-
quired gynecological examinat ions may also be present. Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain

during urination. Typically, the pain experience d during sexual intercourse can be reproduced
during a gynecological examination",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,483
"Marked fear or anxiety about vulvov aginal or pelvic pain either in anticipation of, or during, or
as a result of vaginal penetration  (Criterion A3) is commonly reported by women who have
regularly experienced pain during sexual inte rcourse. This “normal” reaction may lead to
avoidance of sexual/intimate situations. In ot her cases, this marked fear does not appear

course and vaginal penetration situations. Some have describe d this as similar to a phobic
reaction except that the phobic object may be vaginal penetration or the fear of pain",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,483
"Marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor  muscles during attempted vaginal penetration
(Criterion A4) can vary from reflexive-like spasm of the pelvic floor in response to at-
tempted vaginal entry to “normal/voluntary” muscle guarding in response to the antici-
pated or the repeated experience of pain or to fear or anxiety. In the case of “normal/
guarding” reactions, penetratio n may be possible under circumstances of relaxation. The
characterization and assessment of pelvic floo r dysfunction is often best undertaken by a
specialist gynecologist or by a pelvic floor physical therapist.

tions, particularly reduced sexual desire and interest (female sexual interest/arousal disor-
der). Sometimes desire and interest are preserved in sexual situations that are not painful or
do not require penetration. Even when indivi duals with geni to-pelvic pain/p enetration dis-
order report sexual interest/mot ivation, there is of ten behavioral avoidance of sexual situ-
ations and opportunities. Avoidance of gynecological examinations despite medical
recommendations is also frequen t. The pattern of avoidance is si milar to that seen in phobic
disorders. It is common for women who have no t succeeded in having sexual intercourse to
come for treatment only when they wish to conceive. Many women wi th genito-pelvic pain/
penetration disorder will experience associated  relationship/marital problems; they also of-
ten report that the symptoms significantly diminish their fee lings of femininity. 
In addition to the subtype “lifelong/acquired,” five factors should  be considered dur-
ing assessment and diagnosis of genito-pelvi c pain/penetration di sorder because they
may be relevant to etiology and/or treatmen t: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner’s sexual
problems, partner’s health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, dis-
crepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body
image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression,
anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavemen t); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhi-
bitions related to prohibitions against sexual  activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and
5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, cour se, or treatment. Each of these factors may
contribute differently to the presenting symp toms of different women with this disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,483

"Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder 439
Development and Course 
The development and course of genito-pelvic pa in/penetration disorder  is unclear. Because
women generally do not seek treatment until they experience problems in sexual functioning,
it can, in general, be difficult to characterize genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder as life-
long (primary) or acquired (secondary). Alth ough women typically come to clinical atten-
tion after the initiation of sexual activity, there are often earlier clinical signs. For example,
difficulty with or the avoidanc e of use of tampons is an important predictor of later problems",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,484
"Difficulties with vaginal penetration (inability or fear or pain) may not be obvious until sex-
ual intercourse is attempted. Ev en once intercourse is attemp ted, the frequency of attempts
may not be significant or regular. In cases where it is difficult to establish whether symptom-
atology is lifelong or acquired, it is useful to  determine the presence of any consistent period
of successful pain-, fear-, and tension-free intercourse. If the ex perience of such a period can
be established, then genito-pelvic pain/penet ration disorder can be characterized as ac-
quired. Once symptomatology is well establishe d for a period of approximately 6 months,
the probability of spontaneous and significan t symptomatic remission appears to diminish",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,484

In the past, inadequate sexual education and religious orthodoxy have often been consid-

"This perception appears to be confirmed by recent reports from Turkey, a primarily Mus-

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
By definition, the diagnosis of  genito-pelvic pain/penetration  disorder is only given to
women. There is relatively new research concerning urological chronic pelvic pain syn-
drome in men, suggesting that men may expe rience some similar problems. The research
and clinical experience are not sufficiently de veloped yet to justify the application of this
diagnosis to men. Other specified sexual dy sfunction or unspecified sexual dysfunction
may be diagnosed in men appearing to fit this pattern",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,484

"440 Sexual Dysfunctions
Differential Diagnosis
Another medical condition. In many instances, women with genito-pelvic pain/pene-
tration disorder will also be diagnosed with another medical condition (e.g., lichen scle-
rosus, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, vulvovaginal atrophy). In some cases,
treating the medical condition may alleviate the genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,485
"Much of the time, this is not the case. There are no reliable tools or diagnostic methods to
allow clinicians to know whether the medica l condition or genito-pelvic pain/penetration
disorder is primary. Often, the associated medi cal conditions are difficult to diagnose and
treat. For example, the increased incidence of postmenopausal pain during intercourse
may sometimes be attributable to vaginal dr yness or vulvova ginal atrophy as sociated with
declining estrogen levels. The relationship, however, between vulv ovaginal atrophy/dry-
ness, estrogen, and pain is not well understood. 
Somatic symptom and related disorders. Some women with genito-pelvic pain/pene-
tration disorder may also be  diagnosable with somatic symptom disorder. Since both
genito-pelvic pain/penetration  disorder and the somatic symptom and related disorders
are new diagnoses, it is not yet clear whet her they can be reliably differentiated. Some
women diagnosed with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder will also be diagnosed
with a specific phobia. 
Inadequate sexual stimuli. It is important that the clinician,  in considering differential diag-
noses, assess the adequacy of se xual stimuli within the woman’s sexual experience. Sexual sit-
uations in which there is inadequate foreplay or arousal may lead to difficulties in penetration,
pain, or avoidance. Erectile dysfunction or premature ejacul ation in the male partner may
result in difficulties with penetration. These conditions should be carefully assessed. In some
situations, a diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/p enetration disorder may not be appropriate. 
Comorbidity
Comorbidity between genito-pel vic pain/penetration disorder  and other sexual difficul-
ties appears to be common. Comorbidity with relationship distress is also common. This is
not surprising, since in Western cultures the inability to have (pain-free) intercourse with
a desired partner and the avoidance of sexual  opportunities may be either a contributing
factor to or the result of other sexual or re lationship problems. Because pelvic floor symp-
toms are implicated in the diagnosis of geni to-pelvic pain/penetrati on disorder, there is
likely to be a higher prevalence of other diso rders related to the pelvic floor or reproduc-
tive organs (e.g., interstitial cystitis, constipation, vaginal infection, endometriosis, irrita-
ble bowel syndrome)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,485

"Diagnostic Features 
When an assessment for male hypoactive sexu al desire disorder is being made, inter-
personal context must be take n into account. A “desire discrepancy,” in which a man has
lower desire for sexual activity than his partne r, is not sufficient to diagnose male hypo-
active sexual desire d isorder. Both low/absent desire fo r sex and deficient/absent sexual
thoughts or fantasies are required for a diag nosis of the disorder. There may be variation
across men in how sexual desire is expressed. 
The lack of desire for sex and deficient/absent erotic though ts or fantasies must be per-
sistent or recurrent and must occur for a mi nimum duration of approximately 6 months",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,486
"The inclusion of this duration criterion is me ant to safeguard against making a diagnosis in
cases in which a man’s low sexual desire may represent an adaptive response to adverse
life conditions (e.g., concern about a partner’s pregnancy when the man is considering ter-
minating the relationship). The introduction of “approximately” in Criterion B allows for
clinician judgment in cases in which sympto m duration does not meet the recommended
6-month threshold",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,486
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
Male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is some times associated with erectile and/or ejac-
ulatory concerns. For example, persistent difficulties obtaining an erection may lead a man
to lose interest in sexual activity. Men with hypoactive sexual desire  disorder often report
that they no longer initiate sexual activity and that they are minima lly receptive to a part-
ner’s attempt to initiate. Sexual activities (e.g ., masturbation or part nered sexual activity)
may sometimes occur even in the presence of low sexual desire. Relationship-specific pref-
erences regarding patterns of sexual initiation  must be taken into account when making a
diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire di sorder. Although men are more likely to ini-
tiate sexual activity, and thus low desire may be characterized by a pattern of non-initiation,
many men may prefer to have their partner init iate sexual activity. In such situations, the
man’s lack of receptivity to a partner’s initiati on should be considered  when evaluating low
desire",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,486

lowing five factors must be considered duri ng assessment and diagnosis of male hypo-

ment. Each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of dif-
ferent men with this disorder. 
Prevalence 
The prevalence of male hypoactive sexual de sire disorder varies depending on country of
origin and method of assess ment. Approximately 6% of younger men (ages 18–24 years)
and 41% of older men (ages 66–74 years) have problems with sexual desire. However, a
persistent lack of interest in sex, lasting 6 months or more, affects only a small proportion
of men ages 16–44 (1.8%). 
Development and Course 
By definition, lifelong male hypoactive sexual desire disorder indicates that low or no sex-
ual desire has always been present, whereas th e acquired subtype would be assigned if the
man’s low desire developed afte r a period of normal sexual desire. There is a requirement
that low desire persist for approximately 6 months or more; thus, short-term changes in
sexual desire should not be diagnosed as  male hypoactive se xual desire disorder. 
There is a normative age-related decline in se xual desire. Like women, men identify a
variety of triggers for their sexual desire, and they describe a wide  range of reasons that
they choose to engage in sexual activity. Although erotic visual cues may be more potent
elicitors of desire in younger men, the potenc y of sexual cues may decrease with age and
must be considered when evaluating men for hypoactive sexual desire disorder. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Mood and anxiety symptoms appear to be strong predictors of low de-
sire in men. Up to half of men with a past  history of psychiatric symptoms may have mod-
erate or severe loss of desire, compared with only 15% of those without such a history. A
man’s feelings about himself, his perception of his partner’s sexual desire toward him,
feelings of being emotionally connected, and contextual vari ables may all negatively (as
well as positively) affect sexual desire",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,487
"Environmental. Alcohol use may increase the occurr ence of low desire. Among gay men,
self-directed homophobia, interp ersonal problems, attitudes, lack of adequate sex educa-
tion, and trauma resulting from early life ex periences must be taken into account in ex-
plaining the low desire. Social and cultural co ntextual factors should  also be considered",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,487
"Genetic and physiological. Endocrine disorders such as hyperprolactinemia signifi-
cantly affect sexual desire in me n. Age is a significant risk fact or for low desire in men. It is
unclear whether or not men with low desire a lso have abnormally low levels of testoster-
one; however, among hypogonadal men, low desire is common. There also may be a crit-
ical threshold below which testosterone will af fect sexual desire in men and above which
there is little effect of test osterone on men’s desire. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
There is marked variability in prevalence rate s of low desire across cultures, ranging from
12.5% in Northern European me n to 28% in Southeast Asian men ages 40–80 years. Just as
there are higher rates of low desire among East Asian subgroups of women, men of East

Nonsexual mental disorders. Nonsexual mental disorders,  such as major depressive

nadism, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a di-
agnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder w ould not be made. 
Interpersonal factors. If interpersonal or significant co ntextual factors, such as severe
relationship distress or other sig nificant stressors, are associated with the loss of desire in
the man, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,488

asexual, then a diagnosis of male hypoac tive sexual desire disorder is not made.

Premature (early) ejaculation is manifested by ej aculation that occurs prior to or shortly af-
ter vaginal penetration, operationalized by an individual’s estimate of ejaculatory latency

intravaginal ejaculatory latencies are highly co rrelated as long as the ejaculatory latency is
of short duration; therefore, self-reported esti mates of ejaculatory latency are sufficient for
diagnostic purposes. A 60-second intravaginal ejaculatory latency time is an appropriate

Premature (early) ejaculation is a sexual disorder in males. Males and their sexual partners

which may be a reflection of changing societal  attitudes concerning female sexual activity. 
Diagnostic Markers
Ejaculatory latency is usually mo nitored in research settings by  the sexual partner utilizing
a timing device (e.g., stopwatch), though this is  not ideal in real-life sexual situations. For
vaginal intercourse, the time between intravag inal penetration and ejaculation is measured.

Diagnostic Features
The major feature is a disturbance in sexual function that has a temporal relationship with
substance/medication initiation, dose increa se, or substance/medication discontinuation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,493
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Sexual dysfunctions can occur in association wi th intoxication with the following classes of
substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hypnotic s, or anxiolytics; stimulants (including co-
caine); and other (or unknown) substances. Sexual dysfunctions can occur in association
with withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hyp-
notics, or anxiolytics; and other (or unknown)  substances. Medications that can induce sex-
ual dysfunctions include antidepressants, an tipsychotics, and horm onal contraceptives",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,493
"The most commonly reported side effect of antidepressant drugs is difficulty with or-
gasm or ejaculation. Problems with desire and erection are less frequent. Approximately
30% of sexual complaints are clinically sign ificant. Certain agents, such as bupropion and
mirtazapine, appear not to be associated with sexual side effects. 
The sexual problems associated with anti psychotic drugs, including problems with
sexual desire, erection, lubrication, ejaculation, or orgasm, have occurred with typical as
well as atypical agents. However, problems are less common with prolactin-sparing anti-
psychotics than with agents that cause significant prolactin elevation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,493
"Although the effects of mood stabilizers on se xual function are unclear, it is possible
that lithium and anticonvulsants, with the poss ible exception of lamotrigine, have adverse
effects on sexual desire. Problems with orgasm  may occur with gabape ntin. Similarly, there
may be a higher prevalence of erectile and orgasmic problems associ ated with benzodiaz-
epines. There have not been such reports with buspirone.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,493
"Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction 449
Many nonpsychiatric medications, such as ca rdiovascular, cytotoxic, gastrointestinal,
and hormonal agents, are associated with distur bances in sexual function. Illicit substance
use is associated with decreased sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty reach-
ing orgasm. Sexual dysfunctions are also seen  in individuals receiving methadone but are
seldom reported by patients receiving buprenorphine. Chro nic alcohol abuse and chronic
nicotine abuse are associated  with erectile problems",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,494
"Prevalence
The prevalence and the incidence of substa nce/medication-induced sexual dysfunction
are unclear, likely because of  underreporting of treatment-em ergent sexual side effects",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,494
"Data on substance/medication-induced sexual  dysfunction typically concern the effects of
antidepressant drugs. The prevalence of an tidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction var-
ies in part depending on the specific agent.  Approximately 25%–80% of individuals taking
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic anti depressants, serotone rgic antidepressants,
and combined serotonergic-adrenergic antidepr essants report sexual side effects. There
are differences in the incidence of sexual si de effects between some  serotonergic and com-
bined adrenergic-serotonergic antidepressants, although it is unclear if these differences
are clinically significant",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,494

adverse sexual side e ffects, including problems with se xual desire, erection, lubrication,
ejaculation, or orgasm. The incidence of thes e side effects among different antipsychotic
agents is unclear",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,494
"Exact prevalence and incidence of sexual dysfunctions among users of nonpsychiatric
medications such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic, gastrointestinal, and hormonal agents are
unknown. Elevated rates of sexual dysfunction have been reported with methadone or
high-dose opioid drugs for pain. There are incr eased rates of decrease d sexual desire, erec-
tile dysfunction, and difficulty reaching org asm associated with illicit substance use. The
prevalence of sexual problems appears related to chronic drug abuse and appears higher
in individuals who abuse heroin (approximately 60%–70%) than in individuals who abuse
amphetamines or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphe tamine (i.e., MDMA, ecstasy). Elevated
rates of sexual dysfunction are also seen in  individuals receiving methadone but are sel-
dom reported by patients receiving bupren orphine. Chronic alcohol abuse and chronic
nicotine abuse are related to higher rates of erectile problems",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,494
"Development and Course
The onset of antidepressant-induced sexual dy sfunction may be as early as 8 days after the
agent is first taken. Approximately 30% of indi viduals with mild to moderate orgasm de-
lay will experience spontaneous remission of the dysfunction within 6 months. In some
cases, serotonin reuptake inhibitor–induce d sexual dysfunction may persist after the
agent is discontinued. The time to onset of sexual dysfunctio n after initiation of antipsy-
chotic drugs or drugs of abuse is unknown. It  is probable that the adverse effects of nico-
tine and alcohol may not appear until after ye ars of use. Premature (early) ejaculation can
sometimes occur after cessation of opioid use. There is some evidence that disturbances in
sexual function related to substance/medication use increase with age.

"Differential Diagnosis
Non-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunctions. Many mental conditions, such
as depressive, bipolar, anxiet y, and psychotic disorders, ar e associated with disturbances
of sexual function. Thus, differentiating a substance/medication-induced sexual dys-
function from a manifestation of the underlying  mental disorder can be  quite difficult. The
diagnosis is usually established if a close re lationship between substance/medication ini-
tiation or discontinuation is observed. A clear diagnosis can be established if the problem
occurs after substance/medication initiation, dissipates with substance/medication dis-
continuation, and recurs with introduction of the same agent. Most substance/medication-in-
duced side effects occur shortly after initiation  or discontinuation. Sexual side effects that
only occur after chronic use of  a substance/medication may be extremely difficult to di-
agnose with certainty.

"The area of sex and gender is highly controve rsial and has led to a proliferation of terms
whose meanings vary over time and within and between disciplines. An additional source
of confusion is that in English “sex” connotes  both male/female and se xuality. This chapter
employs constructs and terms as they are wide ly used by clinicians from various disci-
plines with specialization in this area. In this chapter, sex and sexual  refer to the biological
indicators of male and female (understood in  the context of reproductive capacity), such
as in sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormon es, and nonambiguous internal and external
genitalia. Disorders of sex deve lopment denote condit ions of inborn somatic deviations of
the reproductive tract from the norm and/or discrepancies among the biological indica-
tors of male and female. Cross-sex  hormone treatment denotes the use of feminizing hor-
mones in an individual assigned male at birth based on traditional biological indicators or
the use of masculinizing hormones in an individual assigned female at birth",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,496
"The need to introduce the term gender  arose with the realization that for individuals
with conflicting or ambiguous biological indicato rs of sex (i.e., “intersex”), the lived role in
society and/or the identification as male or female could not be uniformly associated with
or predicted from the biological indicators and, later, that some individuals develop an
identity as female or male at variance with their uniform set of classical biological indica-
tors. Thus, gender is used to denote the public (and usually legally recognized) lived role as
boy or girl, man or woman, but, in contrast to  certain social construc tionist theories, biolog-
ical factors are seen as contributing, in intera ction with social and psychological factors, to
gender development. Gender assignment  refers to the initial assignment as male or female",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,496
"This occurs usually at birth and, thereby, yields the “natal gender.” Gender-atypical  refers to
somatic features or behaviors th at are not typical (in a statisti cal sense) of individuals with
the same assigned gender in a given so ciety and historical era; for behavior, gender-noncon-
forming  is an alternative descriptive term. Gender reassignment  denotes an official (and usu-
ally legal) change of gender. Gender identity  is a category of social identity and refers to an
individual’s identification as male, female, or, occasionally, some ca tegory other than male
or female. Gender dysphoria  as a general descriptive term refers to an individual’s affective/
cognitive discontent with the assigned gender  but is more specific ally defined when used
as a diagnostic category. Transgender  refers to the broad spectrum of individuals who tran-
siently or persistently identify with a gender different from their natal gender. Transsexual
denotes an individual who seeks,  or has undergone, a social transition from male to female
or female to male, which in many, but not all,  cases also involves a somatic transition by
cross-sex hormone treatment and genital surgery ( sex reassignment surgery). 
Gender dysphoria  refers to the distress that ma y accompany the incongruence between
one’s experienced or expressed gender and one’s assigned gender. Although not all indi-
viduals will experience distress as a result of such incongruence , many are distressed if the

Diagnostic Features 
Individuals with gender dysphoria have a ma rked incongruence between the gender they
have been assigned to (usually  at birth, referred to as natal gender) and their experienced/
expressed gender. This discrepancy is the core componen t of the diagnosis. There must
also be evidence of distress about this inco ngruence. Experienced gender may include al-
ternative gender identities beyond binary stereotypes. Consequently, the distress is not
limited to a desire to simply be of the other gender, but may incl ude a desire to be of an al-
ternative gender, provided that it differs from the individual’s assigned gender. 
Gender dysphoria manifests itself differently in different age groups. Prepubertal natal
girls with gender dysphoria may express the wish  to be a boy, assert they are a boy, or as-
sert they will grow up to be a man. They prefer boys’ clothing and hairstyles, are often
perceived by strangers as boys, and may ask to be called by a boy’s na me. Usually, they dis-
play intense negative reactions to parental attempts to have them wear dresses or other
feminine attire. Some may refuse to attend sc hool or social events where such clothes are
required. These girls may demonstrate marked cr oss-gender identification in role-playing,
dreams, and fantasies. Contac t sports, rough-and-tumble pl ay, traditional boyhood games,
and boys as playmates are most often preferred. They show lit tle interest in stereotypically
feminine toys (e.g., dolls) or activities (e.g.,  feminine dress-up or role-play). Occasionally,
they refuse to urinate in a sitting position. Some natal girls may express a desire to have a
penis or claim to have a penis or that they will  grow one when older. They may also state that
they do not want to deve lop breasts or menstruate",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,498
"Prepubertal natal boys with gender dysphoria may express the wish to be a girl or as-
sert they are a girl or that they will grow up to be a woman. They have a preference for
dressing in girls’ or women’s clothes or ma y improvise clothing from available materials
(e.g., using towels, aprons, and scarves for lo ng hair or skirts). These children may role-
play female figures (e.g., play ing “mother”) and often are intensely interested in female
fantasy figures. Traditional feminine activities, stereotypical games, and pastimes (e.g.,
“playing house”; drawing feminine pictures; watc hing television or videos of favorite fe-
male characters) are most often preferred. Stereotypical female-type dolls (e.g., Barbie) are
often favorite toys, and girls are their prefer red playmates. They avoid rough-and-tumble
play and competitive sports and have little inte rest in stereotypically masculine toys (e.g.,
cars, trucks). Some may pretend not to have a penis and insist on sitting to urinate. More",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,498

rarely, they may state that they find their penis or testes disgusting, that they wish them re-
moved, or that they have, or wish to have, a vagina",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,499
"In young adolescents with gender dysphoria,  clinical features may resemble those of
children or adults with the co ndition, depending on develo pmental level. As secondary
sex characteristics of young adolescents are no t yet fully developed, these individuals may
not state dislike of them, but they are co ncerned about imminent physical changes. 
In adults with gender dysphoria, the di screpancy between experienced gender and
physical sex characteristics is often, but not always, accompanied by a desire to be rid of
primary and/or secondary sex ch aracteristics and/or a strong desire to acquire some pri-
mary and/or secondary sex characteristics of  the other gender. To varying degrees, adults
with gender dysphoria may ad opt the behavior, clothing, and mannerisms of the experi-
enced gender. They feel uncomfortable being re garded by others, or functioning in soci-
ety, as members of their assigned gender. Some adults may have a strong desire to be of a
different gender and treated as such, and they may have an inner certainty to feel and re-
spond as the experienced gender without seek ing medical treatment to alter body char-
acteristics. They may find other ways to resolve the incongruence between experienced/
expressed and assigned gender by partially livin g in the desired role or by adopting a gen-
der role neither conventionally male nor conventionally female",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,499

creasingly, adolescents request, or may obta in without medical prescription and supervi-
sion, hormonal suppressors (“blockers”) of gonadal steroids (e.g., gonadotropin-releasing
hormone [GnRH] analog, spironolactone). Clinically refe rred adolescents often want hor-
mone treatment and many also wish for gender reassignment surgery. Adolescents living in
an accepting environment may open ly express the desire to be and be treated as the experi-
enced gender and dress partly or completely as the experienced gender, have a hairstyle typ-
ical of the experienced gender, preferentially s eek friendships with peer s of the other gender,
and/or adopt a new first name consistent with the experienced gender. Older adolescents,
when sexually active, usually do  not show or allow partners to touch their sexual organs. For
adults with an aversion toward their genitals, sexual activity is constrained by the preference
that their genitals not be seen  or touched by their partners. Some adults may seek hormone
treatment (sometimes without medical prescrip tion and supervision) and gender reassign-
ment surgery. Others are satisfied with either hormone treatment or surgery alone",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,499
"Adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria before gender reassignment are at in-
creased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide a ttempts, and suicides. After gender reassign-
ment, adjustment may vary, an d suicide risk may persist",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,499
"Prevalence 
For natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0.005% to 0.014%, and for natal females,
from 0.002% to 0.003%. Since not all adults seeking hormone treatment and surgical reas-
signment attend specialty clinics, these rate s are likely modest underestimates. Sex differ-
ences in rate of referrals to specialty clinics vary by age group. In children, sex ratios of
natal boys to girls range from 2:1 to 4.5:1. In adolescents, the sex ratio is close to parity; in
adults, the sex ratio favors natal males, with ratios ranging from 1:1 to 6.1:1. In two coun-
tries, the sex ratio appears to favor nata l females (Japan: 2.2:1; Poland: 3.4:1). 
Development and Course 
Because expression of gender dysphoria varies wi th age, there are separate criteria sets for
children versus adolescents and adults. Criter ia for children are defined in a more con-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,499

crete, behavioral manner than those for adolescents and adults. Many of the core criteria
draw on well-documented behavioral gender differences between typically developing
boys and girls. Young children are less likely than older children, ad olescents, and adults
to express extreme and persistent anatomic dysphoria. In adolescents and adults, incon-
gruence between experienced gender and somati c sex is a central feature of the diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,500
"Factors related to distress and impairment al so vary with age. A very young child may
show signs of distress (e.g., intense crying) on ly when parents tell the child that he or she
is “really” not a member of the other gender but only “desires” to be. Distress may not be
manifest in social environments supportive of the child’s desire to live in the role of the
other gender and may emerge only if the desi re is interfered with. In adolescents and
adults, distress may manifest because of stro ng incongruence between experienced gender
and somatic sex. Such distress may, however, be mitigated by  supportive environments and
knowledge that biomedical treatments exist to reduce incongruence. Impairment (e.g.,
school refusal, development of  depression, anxiety, and substance abuse) may be a conse-
quence of gender dysphoria",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,500
"Gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development. For clinic-referred children,
onset of cross-gender behaviors is usually betw een ages 2 and 4 years. This corresponds to
the developmental time period in which most  typically developing children begin ex-
pressing gendered behaviors and interests. For some preschool-age children, both perva-
sive cross-gender behaviors and the expressed desire to be the other gender may be
present, or, more rarely, labeling oneself as a member of the other gender may occur. In
some cases, the expressed desire to be the othe r gender appears later, usually at entry into
elementary school. A small minority of childre n express discomfort wi th their sexual anat-
omy or will state the desire to have a sexual anatomy correspondin g to the experienced
gender (“anatomic dysphoria”). Expressions of anatomic dysphoria become more com-
mon as children with ge nder dysphoria approach and anticipate puberty. 
Rates of persistence of gender dysphoria fr om childhood into adolescence or adulthood
vary. In natal males, persistence has ranged fr om 2.2% to 30%. In natal females, persistence
has ranged from 12% to 50%. Persistence of gender dysphoria is mo destly correlated with
dimensional measures of severity ascertaine d at the time of a childhood baseline assess-
ment. In one sample of natal males, lower socioeconomic background was also modestly
correlated with persistence. It is unclear if particular therapeutic approaches to gender
dysphoria in children are related to rates of  long-term persistence. Extant follow-up sam-
ples consisted of children receiving no formal  therapeutic interventi on or receiving ther-
apeutic interventions of various types, ranging from ac tive efforts to reduce gender
dysphoria to a more neutral, “watchful waiting” approach. It is unclear if children “en-
couraged” or supported to live socially in the desired gender will show  higher rates of per-
sistence, since such children have not yet b een followed longitudinally in a systematic
manner. For both natal male and female ch ildren showing persistence, almost all are
sexually attracted to individuals of their na tal sex. For natal male  children whose gender
dysphoria does not per sist, the majority are androphilic  (sexually attracted to males) and of-
ten self-identify as gay or homosexual (rangi ng from 63% to 100%). In natal female chil-
dren whose gender dysphoria does no t persist, the percentage who are gynephilic  (sexually
attracted to females) and sel f-identify as lesbian is lower (ranging from 32% to 50%)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,500
"In both adolescent and adult natal males, there are t wo broad trajectories for develop-
ment of gender dysphoria: early onset and late onset. Early-onset gender dysphoria  starts in
childhood and continues into adolescence and adulthood; or, there is an intermittent pe-
riod in which the gender dysphoria desists and these individuals self-i dentify as gay or ho-
mosexual, followed by recurren ce of gender dysphoria. Late-onset gender dysphoria  occurs
around puberty or much later in life. Some of these individuals report having had a desire
to be of the other gender in childhood that was not expressed verbally to others. Others do
not recall any signs of childhood gender dysp horia. For adolescent males with late-onset
gender dysphoria, parents often report surpri se because they did not see signs of gender",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,500

dysphoria during childhood. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are more common and
salient in adolescents and adults once seco ndary sex characterist ics have developed. 
Adolescent and adult natal males with earl y-onset gender dysphoria are almost al-
ways sexually attracted to men (androphilic). Adolescents and adults with late-onset gen-
der dysphoria frequently engage in transves tic behavior with sexual excitement. The
majority of these individuals are gynephilic or  sexually attracted to other posttransition
natal males with late-onset ge nder dysphoria. A substantia l percentage of adult males
with late-onset gender dyspho ria cohabit with or are marrie d to natal females. After gen-
der transition, many self-identify as lesbian. Among adult natal males with gender dyspho-
ria, the early-onset group seeks out clinical  care for hormone treatment and reassignment
surgery at an earlier age than does the late-onset group. The late-onset group may have more
fluctuations in the degree of gender dyspho ria and be more ambivalent about and less
likely satisfied after gender  reassignment surgery. 
In both adolescent and adult natal females, the most common  course is the early-onset
form of gender dysphoria. The late-onset fo rm is much less common in natal females com-
pared with natal males. As in natal males with gender dysphoria, there may have been a
period in which the gender dysphoria desisted and these individuals self-identified as les-
bian; however, with recurrence of gender dysphoria, clinical consultation is sought, often
with the desire for hormone treatment and reas signment surgery. Parents of natal adoles-
cent females with the late-onset form also report surprise, as no signs of childhood gender
dysphoria were evident. Expressions of anat omic dysphoria are mu ch more common and
salient in adolescents and adults than in children",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,501
"Adolescent and adult natal females with early-onset gender dysphoria are almost
always gynephilic. Adolescents and adults with  the late-onset form of gender dysphoria
are usually androphilic and after gender transit ion self-identify as gay men. Natal females
with the late-onset form do not have co-occu rring transvestic behavi or with sexual ex-
citement. 
Gender dysphoria in association with a disorder of sex development. Most individuals
with a disorder of sex development who develop gender dysphoria have already come to
medical attention at an early age. For many, st arting at birth, issues of gender assignment
were raised by physicians and parents. More over, as infertility is quite common for this
group, physicians are more willing to perfor m cross-sex hormone treatments and genital
surgery before adulthood",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,501
"Disorders of sex development in general are frequently as sociated with gender-atypi-
cal behavior starting in early childhood. Howeve r, in the majority of cases, this does not
lead to gender dysphoria. As individuals with a disorder of sex development become
aware of their medical history and condition, many experience uncertainty about their
gender, as opposed to developing a firm co nviction that they are another gender. How-
ever, most do not progress to gender transit ion. Gender dysphoria and gender transition
may vary considerably as a function of a disord er of sex development, its severity, and as-
signed gender. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. For individuals with gender dyspho ria without a disorder of sex de-
velopment, atypical gender behavior among individuals with early-onset gender dyspho-
ria develops in early preschool age, and it is possible that a high degree of atypicality
makes the development of gender dysphoria and its persistence into adolescence and
adulthood more likely",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,501

other forms of more general social, psychological, or developmental problems",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,502
"Genetic and physiological. For individuals with gender dy sphoria without a disorder of
sex development, some genetic contribution is suggested by evidence for (weak) familial-
ity of transsexualism among nontwin siblings, increased concordance for transsexualism
in monozygotic compared with dizygotic same -sex twins, and some degree of heritability
of gender dysphoria. As to endocrine findin gs, no endogenous systemic abnormalities in
sex-hormone levels have been found in 46,XY individuals, whereas there appear to be in-
creased androgen levels (in the range found in hirsute women but far below normal male
levels) in 46,XX individuals. Overall, current evidence is insufficient to label gender dys-
phoria without a disorder of sex development as  a form of intersexuality limited to the cen-
tral nervous system",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,502
"In gender dysphoria associated with a disorder of sex development, the likelihood of
later gender dysphoria is increased if pren atal production and utilization (via receptor
sensitivity) of androgens are grossly atypical re lative to what is usually seen in individuals
with the same assigned gender. Examples incl ude 46,XY individuals with a history of nor-
mal male prenatal hormone milieu but inborn nonhormonal genital defects (as in cloacal
bladder exstrophy or penile agenesis) and who have been assigned to the female gender",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,502
"The likelihood of gender dysphoria is furthe r enhanced by additional, prolonged, highly
gender-atypical postnatal androgen exposure with somatic virilization as may occur in fe-

17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrog enase-3 deficiency or in female-raised 46,XX individuals
with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasi a with prolonged periods of non-adherence to
glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Howeve r, the prenatal androgen milieu is more
closely related to gendered behavior than to gender identity. Many individuals with dis-
orders of sex development and markedly gend er-atypical behavior do not develop gender
dysphoria. Thus, gender-atypical behavior by itself should not be interpreted as an indi-
cator of current or future gend er dysphoria. There appears to be a higher rate of gender
dysphoria and patient-initiated gender change from assigned female to male than from as-
signed male to female in 46,XY individu als with a disorder of sex development",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,502

gender expression, is associated with high le vels of stigmatization , discrimination, and
victimization, leading to nega tive self-concept, increased ra tes of mental disorder comor-
bidity, school dropout, and economic marginalization, including unemployment, with at-
tendant social and mental health risks, especially in individuals from resource-poor family

"Differential Diagnosis
Nonconformity to gender roles. Gender dysphoria should be distinguished from sim-
ple nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior by the strong desire to be of an-
other gender than the assigned one and by th e extent and pervasivene ss of gender-variant
activities and interests. The diagnosis is not meant to mere ly describe nonconformity to
stereotypical gender role behavior (e.g., “t omboyism” in girls, “girly-boy” behavior in
boys, occasional cross-dressing in adult men). Given the increased openness of atypical
gender expressions by individuals across the entire range of the transgender spectrum, it
is important that the clinical diagnosis be lim ited to those individuals whose distress and
impairment meet the specified criteria",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,503
"Transvestic disorder. Transvestic disorder occurs in he terosexual (or bisexual) adoles-
cent and adult males (rarely in females) fo r whom cross-dressing behavior generates sex-
ual excitement and causes distress and/or  impairment without drawing their primary
gender into question. It is occasionally ac companied by gender dysphoria. An individual
with transvestic disorder who also has clinica lly significant gender dysphoria can be given
both diagnoses. In many cases of late-onset  gender dysphoria in gynephilic natal males,
transvestic behavior with sexu al excitement is a precursor",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,503

the alteration or removal of a sp ecific body part because it is perceived as abnormally formed,

tion meets criteria for both gender dysphori a and body dysmorphic disorder, both diag-
noses can be given. Individuals wishing to  have a healthy limb amputated (termed by
some body integrity identity disorder) because it makes them feel more “complete” usually

pressive disorders. In prepub ertal children, increasing age is associated with having more
behavioral or emotional problems; this is rela ted to the increasing non-acceptance of gen-
der-variant behavior by others. In older chil dren, gender-variant behavior often leads to
peer ostracism, which may lead to more be havioral problems. The prevalence of mental
health problems differs among cultures; these differences may also be  related to differences
in attitudes toward gender variance in child ren. However, also in  some non-Western cul-
tures, anxiety has been found to be relatively  common in individuals with gender dysphoria,
even in cultures with accepting attitudes to ward gender-variant be havior. Autism spec-
trum disorder is more prevalent in clinica lly referred children with gender dysphoria than
in the general population. Clinically referred adolescents with gender dysphoria appear to
have comorbid mental disorders, with anxi ety and depressive disorders being the most
common. As in children, autism spectrum disorder is more pr evalent in clinically referred

"461Disruptive, Impulse-Control,
and Conduct Disorders
Disruptive, impulse-control,  and conduct disorders include conditions involv-
ing problems in the self-control of emotions  and behaviors. While other disorders in DSM-
5 may also involve problems in  emotional and/or behavioral  regulation, the disorders in
this chapter are unique in that these problems  are manifested in behaviors that violate the
rights of others (e.g., aggression, destructio n of property) and/or that bring the individual
into significant conflict with societal norms or  authority figures. The underlying causes of
the problems in the self-control of emotions  and behaviors can vary greatly across the dis-
orders in this chapter and among individu als within a given diagnostic category. 
The chapter includes opposition al defiant disorder, intermi ttent explosive disorder, con-
duct disorder, antisocial person ality disorder (which is described in the chapter “Personality
Disorders”), pyromania, kleptomania, and ot her specified and unspecified disruptive, im-
pulse-control, and conduct disorders. Althou gh all the disorders in the chapter involve
problems in both emotional and behavioral re gulation, the source of variation among the
disorders is the relative emphas is on problems in the two types of self-control. For example,
the criteria for conduct disorder focus largely on poorly controlled behaviors that violate the
rights of others or that violat e major societal norms. Many of  the behavioral symptoms (e.g.,
aggression) can be a result of poorly controlled  emotions such as anger. At the other extreme,
the criteria for intermittent explosive disorder  focus largely on such poorly controlled emo-
tion, outbursts of anger that are disproportionate to the interpersonal or other provocation
or to other psychosocial  stressors. Intermediate in impact to these two disorders is opposi-
tional defiant disorder, in which the criteria  are more evenly distributed between emotions
(anger and irritation) and be haviors (argumentati veness and defiance). Pyromania and
kleptomania are less commonly used diagnoses characterized by poor impulse control re-
lated to specific behaviors (fire setting or stealing) that reliev e internal tension. Other speci-
fied disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder is a category for conditions in which
there are symptoms of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or other disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders, but th e number of symptoms does not meet the di-
agnostic threshold for any of th e disorders in this chapter, even though there is evidence of
clinically significant impairment  associated with the symptoms. 
The disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders all tend to be more common in
males than in females, although the relative degree of male predominance may differ both
across disorders and within a disorder at differe nt ages. The disorders in  this chapter tend to
have first onset in childhood or adolescence. In fact, it is very rare for ei ther conduct disorder or
oppositional defiant disorder to first emerge in adulthood. There is a developmental relation-
ship between oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, in th at most cases of con-
duct disorder previously would have met criteria for opposition al defiant disorder, at least in
those cases in which conduct disorder emerges prior to adolescence. However, most children
with oppositional defiant disorder do not ev entually develop conduct disorder. Furthermore,
children with opposition al defiant disorder are at risk fo r eventually developing other prob-
lems besides conduct disorder, includ ing anxiety and depr essive disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,506

The disruptive, impulse-control, and conduc t disorders have been linked to a common
externalizing spectrum associated with the personality dimensions labeled as disinhibition

a behavior that is within normal limits from a behavior that is symptomatic. For children
younger than 5 years, the behavior should occur on most days for a period of at least
6 months unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals 5 years or older, the
behavior should occur at least once per week for at least 6 months, unless otherwise
noted (Criterion A8). While these frequency criteria provide guidance on a minimal lev-

toms is an indicator of the severity of the disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,508
"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of oppositional defiant disorder is a frequent and persistent pattern
of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defi ant behavior, or vindictiveness (Criterion
A). It is not unusual for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show the behav-
ioral features of the disorder without proble ms of negative mood. However, individuals
with the disorder who show the angry/irrita ble mood symptoms typically show the be-
havioral features as well. 
The symptoms of oppositional  defiant disorder may be confined to only one setting,
and this is most frequently the home. Indi viduals who show enough symptoms to meet
the diagnostic threshold, even if it is only at  home, may be significantly impaired in their
social functioning. However, in more severe cases, the symptoms of the disorder are pres-
ent in multiple settings. Given that the pervas iveness of symptoms is an indicator of the
severity of the disorder, it is critical that the individual’s behavior be assessed across mul-
tiple settings and relationships. Because these behaviors are common among siblings, they
must be observed during interactions with  persons other than siblings. Also, because
symptoms of the disorder are ty pically more evident in intera ctions with adults or peers
whom the individual knows well, they may not be apparent during a clinical examination. 
The symptoms of oppositional defiant disord er can occur to some degree in individu-
als without this disorder. There are several ke y considerations for de termining if the be-
haviors are symptomatic of oppo sitional defiant disorder. First, the diagnostic threshold
of four or more symptoms within the preceding 6 months must be met. Second, the per-
sistence and frequency of the symptoms should  exceed what is normative for an individ-
ual’s age, gender, and culture. For example, it is not unusual for preschool children to
show temper tantrums on a weekly basis. Te mper outbursts for a preschool child would be
considered a symptom of oppositional defiant d isorder only if they occurred on most days
for the preceding 6 months, if they occurred with at least three other symptoms of the dis-
order, and if the temper outbursts contribu ted to the significant impairment associated
with the disorder (e.g., led to destruction of  property during outbursts, resulted in the
child being asked to leave a preschool). 
The symptoms of the disorder often are part  of a pattern of pr oblematic interactions
with others. Furthermore, individuals with this  disorder typically do not regard themselves
as angry, oppositional, or defian t. Instead, they often justify their behavior as a response to
unreasonable demands or circumstances. Thus, it can be difficult to disentangle the rela-
tive contribution of the individual with the disorder to the problematic interactions he or
she experiences. For example, children with oppositional defiant disorder may have ex-
perienced a history of hostile parenting, and it is often impossible to determine if the
child’s behavior caused the parents to act in a more hostile manner toward the child, if the
parents’ hostility led to the ch ild’s problematic behavior, or if there was so me combination
of both. Whether or not the clinician can sepa rate the relative contributions of potential
causal factors should not influence whether or not the diagnosis is made. In the event that
the child may be living in particularly poor conditions where neglect or mistreatment may
occur (e.g., in institutional settings), clinical attention to reducing the contribution of the
environment may be helpful. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,508
"464 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
In children and adolescents, oppositional defian t disorder is more prevalent in families in
which child care is disrupted by a succession of different caregivers or in families in which
harsh, inconsistent, or negl ectful child-rearing practice s are common. Two of the most
common co-occurring conditions with oppositi onal defiant disorder are attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  and conduct disorder (see the section “Comorbidity” for
this disorder). Oppositional defiant disorder has been associated with increased risk for
suicide attempts, even after comorb id disorders are controlled for. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of oppositional defiant disord er ranges from 1% to 11%, with an average
prevalence estimate of around 3.3%. The rate of oppositional defiant disorder may vary
depending on the age and gender of the child . The disorder appears to be somewhat more
prevalent in males than in females (1.4:1) pr ior to adolescence. This male predominance is
not consistently found in samples of adolescents or adults. 
Development and Course
The first symptoms of oppositional defiant di sorder usually appear during the preschool
years and rarely later than early adolescence.  Oppositional defiant disorder often precedes
the development of conduct disorder, especial ly for those with the childhood-onset type
of conduct disorder. However, many children and adolescents with oppositional defiant
disorder do not subsequently develop cond uct disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder
also conveys risk for the development of anxi ety disorders and major depressive disorder,
even in the absence of conduct disorder. The defiant, argumentative,  and vindictive symp-
toms carry most of the risk for conduct disorder, whereas the angry-irritable mood symp-
toms carry most of the risk for emotional disorders. 
Manifestations of the disorder across de velopment appear consistent. Children and
adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder are at increase d risk for a number of prob-
lems in adjustment as adults, including anti social behavior, impu lse-control problems,
substance abuse, anxiety, and depression",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,509
"Many of the behaviors associated with oppositional defiant disorder increase in fre-
quency during the preschool period and in adol escence. Thus, it is especially critical dur-
ing these development periods that the freq uency and intensity of these behaviors be
evaluated against normative leve ls before it is decided that they are symptoms of opposi-
tional defiant disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,509
"Risk and Prognostic Features
Temperamental. Temperamental factors related to problems in emotional regulation
(e.g., high levels of emotiona l reactivity, poor frustration to lerance) have been predictive
of the disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,509
"Environmental. Harsh, inconsistent, or neglectful child-rearing practices are common in
families of children and adolescents with oppo sitional defiant disorder, and these parent-
ing practices play an important role in many causal theories of the disorder. 
Genetic and physiological. A number of neurobiological markers (e.g., lower heart rate
and skin conductance reactivity; reduced basal cortisol reactivity; abnormalities in the pre-
frontal cortex and amygdala) have been associated with oppositional defiant disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,509
"However, the vast majority of studies have not separated children with oppositional de-
fiant disorder from those with conduct diso rder. Thus, it is unclear whether there are
markers specific to oppositional defiant disorder.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,509
"Oppositional Defiant Disorder 465
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
The prevalence of the disorder in children an d adolescents is relatively consistent across
countries that differ in race and ethnicity",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,510
"Functional Consequences of 
Oppositional Defiant Disorder
When oppositional defiant disorder is pers istent throughout deve lopment, individuals
with the disorder experience frequent conflic ts with parents, teachers, supervisors, peers,
and romantic partners. Such problems often re sult in significant impairments in the indi-
vidual’s emotional, social, academ ic, and occupational adjustment. 
Differential Diagnosis
Conduct disorder. Conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are both related
to conduct problems that  bring the individual in conflict  with adults and other authority
figures (e.g., teachers, work supervisors). Th e behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder
are typically of a less severe nature than those of conduct disorder and do not include ag-
gression toward people or anima ls, destruction of property, or a pattern of theft or deceit",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,510
"Furthermore, oppositional defian t disorder includes problems  of emotional dysregulation
(i.e., angry and irritable mood) that are not in cluded in the definition of conduct disorder. 
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. ADHD is often comorbid  with oppositional de-
fiant disorder. To make the additional diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder, it is impor-
tant to determine that the indivi dual’s failure to conform to requ ests of others is not solely in
situations that demand sustained effort and attention or demand that the individual sit still. 
Depressive and bipolar disorders. Depressive and bipolar di sorders often involve neg-
ative affect and irritability. As a result, a di agnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should
not be made if the symptoms occur exclusiv ely during the course of a mood disorder. 
Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder shares with dis-
ruptive mood dysregulation disorder the symp toms of chronic negative mood and temper
outbursts. However, the severity, frequency, and chronicity of temp er outbursts are more
severe in individuals with di sruptive mood dysregulation disorder than in those with
oppositional defiant disorder. Thus, only a minority of ch ildren and adolescents whose
symptoms meet criteria for oppo sitional defiant disorder woul d also be diagnosed with dis-
ruptive mood dysregulation disorder. When the mood disturbance is severe enough to meet
criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant dis-
order is not given, even if all criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are met",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,510
"Intermittent explosive disorder. Intermittent explosive disorder also involves high
rates of anger. However, indi viduals with this disorder sh ow serious aggr ession toward
others that is not part of the defini tion of oppositional defiant disorder. 
Intellectual disability (intell ectual developmental disorder). In individuals with intel-
lectual disability, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is gi ven only if the opposi-
tional behavior is markedly greater than  is commonly observed among individuals of
comparable mental age and with comparab le severity of intellectual disability. 
Language disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder must  also be distinguished from a
failure to follow directions that is the resu lt of impaired language comprehension (e.g.,
hearing loss). 
Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Oppositional defiant disord er must also be dis-
tinguished from defiance due to  fear of negative evaluation associated with social anxiety
disorder.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,510
"466 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders
Comorbidity 
Rates of oppositional defiant disorder are mu ch higher in samples of children, adoles-
cents, and adults with ADHD, and this may be the result of shared temperamental risk fac-
tors. Also, oppositional defiant disorder of ten precedes conduct di sorder, although this
appears to be most common in children wi th the childhood-onset subtype. Individuals
with oppositional defiant disorder are also at  increased risk for anxiety disorders and ma-
jor depressive disorder, and this seems largel y attributable to the presence of the angry-
irritable mood symptoms. Adolescents and adul ts with oppositional defiant disorder also
show a higher rate of substance use disorders, al though it is unclear if this association is in-
dependent of the comorbidity with conduct disorder. 
Intermittent Explosive Disorder
Diagnostic Criteria 312.34 (F63.81)
A. Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses
as manifested by either of the following:
1. Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights) or
physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring twice
weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months. The physical aggression does not re-
sult in damage or destruction of property and does not result in physical injury to
animals or other individuals. 
2. Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and/or
physical assault involving physical injury against animals or other individuals occur-
ring within a 12-month period. 
B. The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent outbursts is grossly
out of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors. 
C. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they are impulsive and/
or anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective (e.g.,
money, power, intimidation)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,511
"D. The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in the individual or
impairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or are associated with finan-
cial or legal consequences. 
E. Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent developmental level)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,511
"F. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disor-
der (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder, a psychotic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality
disorder) and are not attributable to another  medical condition (e.g., head trauma, Alz-
heimer’s disease) or to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse,
a medication). For children ages 6–18 years, aggressive behavior that occurs as part
of an adjustment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis. 
Note:  This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyper-
activity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum dis-
order when recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually seen
in these disorders and warrant independent clinical attention",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,511
"Diagnostic Features
The impulsive (or anger-based) aggressive outb ursts in intermittent explosive disorder have
a rapid onset and, typically, li ttle or no prodromal period. Ou tbursts typically last for less",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,511
"Intermittent Explosive Disorder 467
than 30 minutes and commonly occur in respon se to a minor provocation by a close intimate
or associate. Individuals with intermittent ex plosive disorder often have less severe epi-
sodes of verbal and/or nondamaging, nondestruc tive, or noninjurious physical assault (Cri-
terion A1) in between more severe destructive/ assaultive episodes (Cri terion A2). Criterion
A1 defines frequent (i.e., twice weekly, on aver age, for a period of 3 months) aggressive out-
bursts characterized by  temper tantrums, tirades, verbal  arguments or fights, or assault
without damage to objects or without injury to animals or other individuals. Criterion A2
defines infrequent (i.e., three in a 1-year pe riod) impulsive aggressi ve outbursts character-
ized by damaging or destroying an object, regardless of its tangible value, or by assaulting/
striking or otherwise causing physical injury to an animal or to another individual. Regard-
less of the nature of the impulsive aggressive outburst, the core feature of intermittent
explosive disorder is failure to control impulsiv e aggressive behavior in  response to subjec-
tively experienced provocation (i.e., psychosocial  stressor) that would not typically result in
an aggressive outburst (Criterion B). The aggressive outbursts are generally impulsive and/
or anger-based, rather than premeditated or instrumental (Criterion C) and are associated
with significant distress or impairment in psyc hosocial function (Cri terion D). A diagnosis
of intermittent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals younger than 6 years,
or the equivalent developmental level (Criterion  E), or to individual s whose aggressive out-
bursts are better explained by another mental di sorder (Criterion F). A diagnosis of intermit-
tent explosive disorder should not be gi ven to individuals with disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder or to individuals whose impulsive aggressive outbursts are attribut-
able to another medical condition or to the phys iological effects of a substance (Criterion F)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,512
"In addition, children ages 6–18 years should not receive this diagnosis when impulsive ag-
gressive outbursts occur in the context of an adjustment disorder (Criterion F). 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
Mood disorders (unipolar), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are associated
with intermittent explosive di sorder, although onset of thes e disorders is typically later
than that of intermitte nt explosive disorder. 
Prevalence
One-year prevalence data for intermittent expl osive disorder in the United States is about
2.7% (narrow definition). Intermittent explosive disorder is more prevalent among
younger individuals (e.g., youn ger than 35–40 years), compared with older individuals
(older than 50 years), and in individuals with a high school education or less. 
Development and Course
The onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive beha vior is most common in late
childhood or adolescence and ra rely begins for the first time  after age 40 years. The core
features of intermitte nt explosive disorder, typically, ar e persistent and continue for many
years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,512
"The course of the disorder may be episodic, with recurrent periods of impulsive ag-
gressive outbursts. Intermittent  explosive disorder appears to follow a chronic and persis-
tent course over many years. It also appears to be quite common regardless of the presence
or absence of attentio n-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or disruptive, impulse-
control, and conduct disorders (e.g., conduct disorder, oppo sitional defiant disorder). 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Environmental. Individuals with a history of physica l and emotional trauma during the
first two decades of life are at increased risk for intermittent  explosive disorder. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,512
"468 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders
Genetic and physiological. First-degree relatives of individuals with intermittent ex-
plosive disorder are at increase d risk for intermittent explos ive disorder, and twin studies
have demonstrated a substantial geneti c influence for impulsive aggression. 
Research provides neurobiolo gical support for the presence of serotonergic abnormal-
ities, globally and in the brain, specifically in areas of the limbic sy stem (anterior cingulate)
and orbitofrontal cortex in individuals with  intermittent explos ive disorder. Amygdala
responses to anger stimuli, during function al magnetic resonance imaging scanning, are
greater in individuals with intermittent expl osive disorder compared with healthy indi-
viduals",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,513
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
The lower prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder in some regions (Asia, Middle
East) or countries (Romania, Nigeria), compared  with the United States, suggests that in-
formation about recurrent, prob lematic, impulsive aggressive behaviors either is not elic-
ited on questioning or is less likely to be present, because of cultural factors",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,513
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
In some studies the prevalence of intermittent explosive diso rder is greater in males than
in females (odds ratio = 1.4–2.3); other st udies have found no gender difference. 
Functional Consequences of 
Intermittent Explosive Disorder
Social (e.g., loss of friends, relatives, marita l instability), occupational (e.g., demotion, loss
of employment), financial (e.g., due to value of objects destroyed), and legal (e.g., civil
suits as a result of aggressive behavior against person or prop erty; criminal charges for as-
sault) problems often develop as a result of intermit tent explosive disorder. 
Differential Diagnosis
A diagnosis of intermittent ex plosive disorder shou ld not be made when Criteria A1 and/
or A2 are only met during an  episode of another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive
disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder ), or when impulsive aggressive outbursts
are attributable to another me dical condition or to the physio logical effects of a substance
or medication. This diagnosis also should not be made, particularly in children and ado-
lescents ages 6–18 years, when the impulsive aggressive outbursts occur in the context of
an adjustment disorder. Other examples in which recurrent, proble matic, impulsive ag-
gressive outbursts may, or may not, be diag nosed as intermittent explosive disorder in-
clude the following. 
Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. In contrast to intermittent explosive disorder,
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is charac terized by a persistently  negative mood state
(i.e., irritability, anger) most of the day, nearly every day, between impulsive aggressive out-
bursts. A diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregul ation disorder can only be given when the on-
set of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts is before age 10 years. Finally, a
diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation di sorder should not be made for the first time
after age 18 years. Otherwise, these diagnoses are mutually exclusive. 
Antisocial personality disorder or  borderline personality disorder. Individuals with an-
tisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder often display recurrent,
problematic impulsive aggressive outbursts. However, the level of impulsive aggression
in individuals with antisocial personality di sorder or borderline personality disorder is
lower than that in individuals with  intermittent explosive disorder.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,513
"Conduct Disorder 469
Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, an d personality change due to another med-
ical condition, aggressive type. A diagnosis of intermittent ex plosive disorder should not
be made when aggressive outbur sts are judged to result from the physiological effects of an-
other diagnosable medical condition (e.g., brain in jury associated with a change in personality
characterized by aggressive outbursts; comple x partial epilepsy). Nonspecific abnormalities
on neurological examination (e.g., “soft signs”) and nonspecific electroencephalographic
changes are compatible with a diagnosis of interm ittent explosive disorder  unless there is a di-
agnosable medical condition that better expl ains the impulsive aggressive outbursts. 
Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal. A diagnosis of inte rmittent explosive
disorder should not be made when impulsive aggressive outbursts are nearly always as-
sociated with intoxicati on with or withdrawal from substa nces (e.g., alcohol, phencyclidine,
cocaine and other stimulants, barbiturates, inhalants). However, when  a sufficient number
of impulsive aggressive outbur sts also occur  in the absence of substance intoxication or
withdrawal, and these warrant in dependent clinical attention,  a diagnosis of intermittent
explosive disorder may be given. 
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disor-
der, or autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with any of these childhood-onset dis-
orders may exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. Individu als with ADHD are typically
impulsive and, as a result, may also exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. While indi-
viduals with conduct disorder can exhibit impulsive aggressive outbur sts, the form of ag-
gression characterized by the diagnostic criter ia is proactive and predatory. Aggression in
oppositional defiant disorder is typically char acterized by temper ta ntrums and verbal ar-
guments with authority figures, whereas impu lsive aggressive outbursts in intermittent
explosive disorder are in response to a broader array of provocation and include physical
assault. The level of impulsive aggression in individuals with a history of one or more of
these disorders has been reported as lower than that in comparab le individuals whose
symptoms also meet intermitte nt explosive disorder Criteria  A through E. Accordingly, if
Criteria A through E are also met, and the impulsive aggressive out bursts warrant inde-
pendent clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent expl osive disorder may be given. 
Comorbidity
Depressive disorders, anxiet y disorders, and substance us e disorders are most commonly
comorbid with intermittent explosive disord er. In addition, individuals with antisocial
personality disorder or borderline personality disorder, and individuals with a history of
disorders with disruptive beha viors (e.g., ADHD, conduct di sorder, oppositional defiant

opmental difficulties. Individuals with childho od-onset type are more  likely to have per-
sistent conduct disorder into adulthood than are those with adolescent-onset type. As
compared with individuals with childhood-ons et type, individuals with adolescent-onset
conduct disorder are less likely to display a ggressive behaviors and tend to have more
normative peer relationships (although they often display conduct problems in the com-
pany of others). These individuals are less lik ely to have conduct disorder that persists into

olated (Criterion A). These be haviors fall into four main groupings: aggressive conduct
that causes or threatens physical harm to other people or animals (Criteria A1–A7); non-
aggressive conduct that causes property loss or damage (Criteria A8–A9); deceitfulness or
theft (Criteria A10–A12); and serious violations  of rules (Criteria A13–A15). Three or more
characteristic behaviors must ha ve been present during the pa st 12 months, with at least
one behavior present in the past 6 months. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically
significant impairment in social, academic, or  occupational functioning (Criterion B). The
behavior pattern is usually pres ent in a variety of settings, su ch as home, at school, or in
the community. Because individu als with conduct disorder ar e likely to minimize their
conduct problems, the clinician often must rely on additional informants. However, infor-
mants’ knowledge of the individual’s conduct problems may be limited if they have inad-
equately supervised the individual or the individual has concealed symptom behaviors",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,517
"Individuals with conduct disorder often initiate aggressive behavior and react aggres-
sively to others. They may display bullying, th reatening, or intimidating behavior (includ-
ing bullying via messaging on Web-based social  media) (Criterion A1); initiate frequent
physical fights (Criteri on A2); use a weapon that can caus e serious physical harm (e.g., a bat,
brick, broken bottle, knife, gun) (Criterion A3);  be physically cruel to people (Criterion A4)
or animals (Criterion A5); steal while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching,
extortion, armed robbery) (Criterion A6); or force someone into sexual activity (Criterion A7)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,517
"Physical violence may take the form of rape, assault, or, in rare cases, homicide. Deliberate
destruction of others’ property may include delibe rate fire setting with the intention of caus-
ing serious damage (Criterion A8) or deliberate destroying of  other people’s property in
other ways (e.g., smashing car windows, vandal izing school property) (C riterion A9). Acts of
deceitfulness or theft may include breaking into someone else’s house, building, or car (Crite-
rion A10); frequently lying or breaking promises  to obtain goods or favors or to avoid debts
or obligations (e.g., “conning” other individual s) (Criterion A11); or stealing items of non-
trivial value without confronting the victim (e.g.,  shoplifting, forgery, fraud) (Criterion A12)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,517
"Individuals with conduct diso rder may also frequently commit serious violations of
rules (e.g., school, parental, workplace). Children with cond uct disorder often have a pat-
tern, beginning before age 13 years, of stay ing out late at night despite parental prohi-
bitions (Criterion A13). Children may also show a pattern of running away from home
overnight (Criterion A14). To be considered  a symptom of conduct disorder, the running
away must have occurred at le ast twice (or only once if the individual did not return for a
lengthy period). Runaway episodes that occur as a direct consequence of physical or sex-
ual abuse do not typically qualify for this criterion. Children with conduct disorder may
often be truant from school, beginning prior to age 13 years (Criterion A15)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,517

ality features of trait negative emotionality and poor self-control, including poor frustra-
tion tolerance, irritability, temper outbursts,  suspiciousness, insens itivity to punishment,
thrill seeking, and recklessnes s, frequently co-occur with conduct disorder. Substance
misuse is often an associated fe ature, particularly in adolescent females. Suicidal ideation,
suicide attempts, and completed suicide occur at  a higher-than-expected rate in individu-
als with conduct disorder. 
Prevalence
One-year population prevalence estimates range from 2% to more than 10%, with a median
of 4%. The prevalence of conduct disorder a ppears to be fairly consistent across various
countries that differ in race and ethnicity. Pr evalence rates rise from  childhood to adoles-
cence and are higher among males than amon g females. Few children with impairing con-
duct disorder receive treatment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,518
"Development and Course
The onset of conduct disorder may occur as ea rly as the preschool years, but the first sig-
nificant symptoms usually emerge during the period from middle childhood through
middle adolescence. Oppositi onal defiant disorder is a common precursor to the child-
hood-onset type of conduct disorder. Conduct disorder may be diagnosed in adults, how-
ever, symptoms of conduct di sorder usually emerge in ch ildhood or adol escence, and
onset is rare after age 16 years. The course of  conduct disorder after onset is variable. In a
majority of individuals, the disorder remits by adulthood. Many individuals with conduct
disorder—particularly those with adolescent-onset type and those with few and milder
symptoms—achieve adequate social and occupa tional adjustment as adults. However, the
early-onset type predicts a worse prognosis and an increased risk of criminal behavior,
conduct disorder, and substance-related disord ers in adulthood. Individuals with conduct
disorder are at risk for later mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress dis-
order, impulse-control disord ers, psychotic disorders, so matic symptom disorders, and
substance-related disorders as adults. 
Symptoms of the disorder vary with age as the individual develops increased physical
strength, cognitive abilities, and sexual ma turity. Symptom behaviors that emerge first
tend to be less serious (e.g., lying, shoplifti ng), whereas conduct problems that emerge last
tend to be more severe (e.g., rape, theft wh ile confronting a victim ). However, there are
wide differences among individuals, with some enga ging in the more damaging behaviors
at an early age (which is predictive of a worse prognosis). When individuals with conduct
disorder reach adulthood, symptoms of aggres sion, property destruction, deceitfulness,
and rule violation, including violence against co-workers, partners, and children, may be ex-
hibited in the workplace and the home, such that antisocial personality disorder may be
considered. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. Temperamental risk factors include a difficult undercontrolled infant
temperament and lower-than-average intelligence , particularly with regard to verbal IQ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,518
"Environmental. Family-level risk factors include parental rejection and neglect, inconsis-
tent child-rearing practices, harsh discipline, physical or sexual abuse, lack of supervision,
early institutional living, freque nt changes of caregivers, large family size, parental criminal-
ity, and certain kinds of familial psychopath ology (e.g., substance-related disorders). Com-
munity-level risk factors include peer rejection, association with a delinquent peer group,
and neighborhood exposure to violence. Both types of risk factors te nd to be more common
and severe among individuals with the child hood-onset su btype of conduct disorder. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,518
"474 Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders
Genetic and physiological. Conduct disorder is influenced by both genetic and envi-
ronmental factors. The risk is increased in child ren with a biological or adoptive parent or
a sibling with conduct disorder. The disorder also appears to be more common in children
of biological parents with severe alcohol us e disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, or
schizophrenia or biological parents who have  a history of ADHD or conduct disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,519
"Family history particularly characterizes in dividuals with the childhood-onset subtype of
conduct disorder. Slower resting heart rate has been reliably noted in individuals with
conduct disorder compared with those without the disorder, and this marker is not char-
acteristic of any other mental  disorder. Reduced autonomic fe ar conditioning, particularly
low skin conductance, is also well documented. However, these psychophysiological find-
ings are not diagnostic of the disorder. Structural and functional differences in brain areas
associated with affect regulation and affect processing, particularly frontotemporal-limbic
connections involving the brain’s ventral pref rontal cortex and amygdala, have been con-
sistently noted in individuals with conduct d isorder compared with those without the dis-
order. However, neuroimaging findings are not diagnostic of the disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,519
"Course modifiers. Persistence is more likely for indi viduals with behaviors that meet
criteria for the childhood-onset subtype and qualify for the specifier “with limited pro-
social emotions”. The risk that conduct disorder will persist is also increased by co-occurring
ADHD and by substance abuse. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Conduct disorder diagnosis may at times be potentially misapplied to individuals in set-
tings where patterns of disruptive behavior are viewed as near-normative (e.g., in very
threatening, high-crime areas or war zones). Therefore, the context in which the undesir-
able behaviors have occurr ed should be considered",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,519
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Males with a diagnosis of conduct disorder frequently exhibit fighting, stealing, vandalism,
and school discipline problems. Females with a diagnosis of conduct disorder are more likely
to exhibit lying, truancy, running away, subs tance use, and prostitution. Whereas males tend
to exhibit both physical aggression and relation al aggression (behavior that harms social re-
lationships of others), females tend to exhibit relatively more relational aggression",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,519
"Functional Consequences  of Conduct Disorder 
Conduct disorder behaviors may lead to sch ool suspension or expulsion, problems in
work adjustment, legal difficulties, sexually  transmitted diseases, unplanned pregnancy,
and physical injury from accidents or fights . These problems may preclude attendance in
ordinary schools or living in a parental or foster home. Conduct disorder is often associ-
ated with an early onset of sexual behavior, alcohol use, to bacco smoking, use of illegal
substances, and reckless and risk-taking acts. Ac cident rates appear to be higher among in-
dividuals with conduct disord er compared with those without the disorder. These func-
tional consequences of conduct disorder may predict health difficulties when individuals
reach midlife. It is not uncommon for individu als with conduct disorder to come into con-
tact with the criminal justice system for engaging in illegal behavior. Conduct disorder is
a common reason for treatment referral and is frequently diagnosed in mental health fa-
cilities for children, especially in forensic practice. It is associated with impairment that is
more severe and chronic than that expe rienced by other clinic-referred children",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,519

thority figures (e.g., parents, teachers, work supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional
defiant disorder are typically of a less severe nature than those of individuals with conduct
disorder and do not include aggression towa rd individuals or animals, destruction of
property, or a pattern of theft or deceit. Fu rthermore, oppositional defiant disorder in-
cludes problems of emotional dysregulation (i.e ., angry and irritable mood) that are not in-
cluded in the definition of conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both oppositional
defiant disorder and conduct disord er, both diagnoses can be given",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,520
"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although children with  ADHD often exhibit
hyperactive and impulsive behavior that may be disruptive, this behavior does not by it-
self violate societal norms or the rights of others and therefore does not usually meet cri-
teria for conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both ADHD and conduct disorder, both
diagnoses should be given",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,520
"Depressive and bipolar disorders. Irritability, aggression, and conduct problems can
occur in children or adolescents with a majo r depressive disorder, a bipolar disorder, or
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The behaviorial problems associated with these
mood disorders can usually be distinguished from the pattern of conduct problems seen in
conduct disorder based on their course. Spec ifically, persons with conduct disorder will
display substantial levels of aggressive or non-aggressive conduct problems during peri-
ods in which there is no mood disturbance, ei ther historically (i.e., a history of conduct
problems predating the onset of  the mood disturbance) or concurrently (i.e., display of
some conduct problems that ar e premeditated and do not occur during periods of intense
emotional arousal). In those cases in which cr iteria for conduct disorder and a mood dis-
order are met, both diagnoses can be given. 
Intermittent explosive disorder. Both conduct disorder and intermittent explosive dis-
order involve high rates of aggression. However, the aggression in individuals with inter-
mittent explosive disorder is limited to impu lsive aggression and is not premeditated, and
it is not committed in order to achieve some tangible objectiv e (e.g., money, power, intim-
idation). Also, the definition of intermittent  explosive disorder does not include the non-
aggressive symptoms of conduct disorder. If criteria for both  disorders are met, the diag-
nosis of intermittent explosive disorder sh ould be given only when  the recurrent impul-
sive aggressive outbursts warrant in dependent clinical attention. 
Adjustment disorders. The diagnosis of an adjustment di sorder (with disturbance of con-
duct or with mixed disturbance of emotions an d conduct) should be co nsidered if clinically
significant conduct problems that  do not meet the criteria for another specific disorder de-
velop in clear association with the onset of a psychosocial stressor and do not resolve within
6 months of the termination of the stressor (o r its consequences). Cond uct disorder is diag-
nosed only when the conduct problems represen t a repetitive and pers istent pattern that is
associated with impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,520
"Comorbidity
ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder are both common in individuals with conduct
disorder, and this comorbid presentation pr edicts worse outcomes.  Individuals who show
the personality features associated with anti social personality disorder often violate the
basic rights of others or violate major age-appr opriate societal norms, and as a result their
pattern of behavior often meets criteria fo r conduct disorder. Conduct disorder may also
co-occur with one or more of the following me ntal disorders: specif ic learning disorder,
anxiety disorders, depressive or bipolar diso rders, and substance-related disorders. Aca-
demic achievement, particularly in reading an d other verbal skills, is often below the level
expected on the basis of age and intelligence and may justify the additional diagnosis of
specific learning disorder or a communication disorder.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,520

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of pyromania is the pres ence of multiple episodes of deliberate and
purposeful fire setting (Criterion A). Individuals with this disorder experience tension or af-
fective arousal before setting a fi re (Criterion B). There is a f ascination with, interest in, cu-
riosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses,
consequences) (Criterion C). Individuals with this disorder are often regular “watchers” at
fires in their neig hborhoods, may set off false alarms, and derive pleasure from institutions,
equipment, and personnel associat ed with fire. They may spend time at the local fire depart-
ment, set fires to be affiliated with the fire department, or even beco me firefighters. Individ-
uals with this disorder experi ence pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting the fire,
witnessing its effects, or participating in its aftermath (Criterion D). The fire setting is not
done for monetary gain, as an expression of so ciopolitical ideology, to conceal criminal ac-
tivity, to express anger or vengeance, to impr ove one’s living circumstances, or in response
to a delusion or a hallucination (Criterion E). The fire setting does not result from impaired
judgment (e.g., in major neurocog nitive disorder or intellectual disability [intellectual devel-
opmental disorder]). The diagnosis is not made if the fire setting is better explained by con-
duct disorder, a manic episode, or antiso cial personality disorder (Criterion F)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,521

they may derive satisfaction from the resulting property destruction. The behaviors may
lead to property damage, legal co nsequences, or injury or loss of  life to the fire setter or to
others. Individuals who impulsively set fires (who may or may not have pyromania) often
have a current or past history of alcohol use disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,522
"Prevalence
The population prevalence of pyromania is no t known. The lifetime prevalence of fire set-
ting, which is just one component of pyromania and not sufficient for a diagnosis by itself,
was reported as 1.13% in a population sample, but the mo st common como rbidities were
antisocial personality disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, and pathological
gambling (gambling disorder). In contrast, pyromania as a primary diagnosis appears to
be very rare. Among a sample of persons reachi ng the criminal system with repeated fire
setting, only 3.3% had symptoms th at met full criteria  for pyromania. 
Development and Course
There are insufficient data to establish a typi cal age at onset of pyromania. The relation-
ship between fire setting in childhood and pyromania in adulthood has not been docu-
mented. In individuals with pyromania, fire -setting incidents are episodic and may wax
and wane in frequency. Longitudinal course is unknown. Although fire setting is a major
problem in children and adolescents (over 40% of  those arrested for arson offenses in the
United States are younger than 18 years), pyromania in childhood appears to be rare. Ju-
venile fire setting is usually associated with  conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperac-
tivity disorder, or an  adjustment disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,522
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Pyromania occurs much more often in males, es pecially those with poorer social skills and
learning difficulties",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,522
"Differential Diagnosis
Other causes of intentional fire setting. It is important to rule out other causes of fire
setting before giving the diagnosis of pyroma nia. Intentional fire setting may occur for
profit, sabotage, or revenge; to  conceal a crime; to make a po litical statement (e.g., an act of
terrorism or protest); or to attract attention or recognition (e.g., setting a fire in order to dis-
cover it and save the day). Fire setting may also occur as part of developmental experi-
mentation in childhood (e.g., playing with matches, lighters, or fire). 
Other mental disorders. A separate diagnosis of pyromania is not given when fire set-
ting occurs as part of conduct disorder, a mani c episode, or antisocial personality disorder,
or if it occurs in response to a delusion or a hallucination (e.g., in schizophrenia) or is at-
tributable to the physiological effects of anot her medical condition (e.g., epilepsy). The di-
agnosis of pyromania should also not be gi ven when fire setting results from impaired
judgment associated with major neurocognitive  disorder, intellectual disability, or sub-
stance intoxication",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,522

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of kleptomania is the recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal items
even though the items are not ne eded for personal use or for their monetary value (Criterion
A). The individual experiences a rising subjective  sense of tension before  the theft (Criterion B)
and feels pleasure, gratification, or relief when  committing the theft (Criterion C). The stealing
is not committed to express anger or vengeance, is not done in response to a delusion or hal-
lucination (Criterion D), and is  not better explained by conduc t disorder, a manic episode, or
antisocial personality disorder (Criterion E). The objects are stolen despite the fact that they are
typically of little value to the individual, who could have afforded to pay for them and often
gives them away or discards them. Occasionally  the individual may hoard the stolen objects or
surreptitiously return them. Al though individuals with this disorder will generally avoid
stealing when immediate arrest is probable (e.g., in full view of a po lice officer), they usually
do not preplan the thefts or fully take into ac count the chances of apprehension. The stealing is
done without assistance from, or collaboration with, others",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,523
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with kleptomania typically attempt to resist the impulse to steal, and they are
aware that the act is wrong and senseless. The individual frequently fears being appre-
hended and often feels depressed or guilty  about the thefts. Neurotransmitter pathways
associated with behavioral addictions, includ ing those associated with  the serotonin, do-
pamine, and opioid systems,  appear to play a role in kleptomania as well",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,523

Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. There are no controlled family history studies of kleptoma-
nia. However, first-degree relatives of in dividuals with klepto mania may have higher
rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder than the general population. There also appears to
be a higher rate of substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder, in relatives of
individuals with kleptomania than in the general population.

"Differential Diagnosis
Ordinary theft. Kleptomania should be distinguishe d from ordinary acts of theft or
shoplifting. Ordinary theft (whether planned or impulsive) is deliberate and is motivated
by the usefulness of the object or its monetary  worth. Some individuals, especially adoles-
cents, may also steal on a dare, as an act of re bellion, or as a rite of passage. The diagnosis
is not made unless other characteristic featur es of kleptomania are also present. Klepto-
mania is exceedingly rare, whereas sh oplifting is relatively common. 
Malingering. In malingering, individuals may simulate the symptoms of kleptomania to
avoid criminal prosecution. 
Antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder. Antisocial personality disorder
and conduct disorder are distinguished from kleptomania by a general pattern of antiso-
cial behavior. 
Manic episodes, psychotic episodes, and major neurocognitive disorder. Kleptomania
should be distinguished from intentional or inadvertent stealing that may occur during a

a result of a major neurocognitive disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,524

"481Substance-Related and
Addictive Disorders
The substance-related  disorders encompass 10 separate classes of drugs: alco-
hol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens (with separate categories for phencyclidine [or sim-
ilarly acting arylcyclohexylamines] and ot her hallucinogens); inhalants; opioids;
sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimul ants (amphetamine-type substances, cocaine,
and other stimulants); tobacco ; and other (or unknown) subs tances. These 10 classes are
not fully distinct. All drugs that are taken in excess have in common direct activation of
the brain reward system, which is involved in  the reinforcement of behaviors and the pro-
duction of memories. They produce such an in tense activation of the reward system that
normal activities may be neglected. Inst ead of achieving reward system activation
through adaptive behaviors, drugs of abuse directly activate the reward pathways. The
pharmacological mechanisms by which each class  of drugs produces reward are different,
but the drugs typically activate the system and produce feelings of pleasure, often re-
ferred to as a “high.” Furthe rmore, individuals with lower levels of self-control, which
may reflect impairments of brain inhibitory mechanisms, may be particularly predisposed
to develop substance use disord ers, suggesting that the root s of substance use disorders
for some persons can be seen in behaviors long before the onset of actual substance use
itself",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,526
"In addition to the substance-related disorders, this chapter also includes gambling dis-
order, reflecting evidence that gambling be haviors activate reward systems similar to
those activated by drugs of abuse and produce some behavi oral symptoms that appear
comparable to those produced by the substa nce use disorders. Other excessive behavioral
patterns, such as Internet gaming, have also been described, but the research on these and
other behavioral syndromes is less clear. Thus, groups of repetitive behaviors, which some
term behavioral addictions,  with such subcategories as “sex addiction,” “exercise addiction,”
or “shopping addiction,” are not included becaus e at this time there is insufficient peer-re-
viewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and co urse descriptions needed to
identify these behaviors as mental disorders. 
The substance-related disorder s are divided into two groups: substance use disorders
and substance-induced disorders. The followi ng conditions may be classified as sub-
stance-induced: intoxication, withdrawal, an d other substance/medication-induced men-
tal disorders (psychotic disord ers, bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders,
anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive and re lated disorders, sleep disorders, sexual dys-
functions, delirium, and neurocognitive disorders). 
The current section begins with a general di scussion of criteria sets for a substance
use disorder, substance intoxication and withdrawal, and other substance/medication-
induced mental disorders, at  least some of which are a pplicable across classes of sub-
stances. Reflecting some unique  aspects of the 10 substance classes relevant to this chapter,
the remainder of the chapter is  organized by the class of substance and describes their
unique aspects. To facilitate differential diagnosis, the text and criteria for the remaining
substance/medication-induced mental disorder s are included with disorders with which
they share phenomenology (e.g ., substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is in
the chapter “Depressive Disorder s”). The broad diagnostic cate gories associated with each
specific group of substances are shown in Table 1.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,526

"Substance Use Disorders 483
Substance-Related Disorders
Substance Use Disorders
Features
The essential feature of a substance use disorder  is a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and
physiological symptoms indicating that the individual continues using the substance de-
spite significant substance-related problems. As seen in Table 1, the diagnosis of a sub-
stance use disorder can be applied to all 10 cl asses included in this chapter except caffeine",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,528
"For certain classes some symptoms are less sa lient, and in a few instances not all symptoms
apply (e.g., withdrawal symptoms are not sp ecified for phencyclidin e use disorder, other
hallucinogen use disorder, or  inhalant use disorder). 
An important characteristic of substance use disorders is an underlying change in brain cir-
cuits that may persist beyond detoxification, part icularly in individuals with severe disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,528
"The behavioral effect s of these brain changes may be exhibited in the repeated relapses and in-
tense drug craving when the individuals are exposed to drug-related stimuli. These persistent
drug effects may benefit from long-term approaches to treatment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,528
"Overall, the diagnosis of a su bstance use disorder is based on a pathological pattern of
behaviors related to use of the substance. To as sist with organization, Criterion A criteria can
be considered to fit within overall groupings of impaired control,  social impairment,  risky use,
and pharmacological criteria.  Impaired control over substance use is the first criteria grouping
(Criteria 1–4). The individual may take the substance in larger amounts or over a longer pe-
riod than was originally intended (Criterion 1). The individual may express a persistent de-
sire to cut down or regulate substance use and may report multiple unsuccessful efforts to
decrease or discontinue use (Cri terion 2). The individual may sp end a great deal of time ob-
taining the substance, using the substance, or recovering from  its effects (Criterion 3). In
some instances of more severe substance use disorders, virtually all of the individual’s daily
activities revolve around  the substance. Craving (Criterion 4) is manifested by an intense de-
sire or urge for the drug that may occur at an y time but is more likely when in an environ-
ment where the drug previous ly was obtained or used. Cr aving has also been shown to
involve classical conditioning and is associated with activation of specific reward structures
in the brain. Craving is queried by asking if there has ever been a time when they had such
strong urges to take the drug th at they could not think of anythi ng else. Current craving is of-
ten used as a treatment outcome measure becaus e it may be a signal of impending relapse",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,528
"Social impairment is the second grouping of  criteria (Criteria 5–7) . Recurrent substance
use may result in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, sc hool, or home (Crite-
rion 5). The individual may continue substanc e use despite having persistent or recurrent
social or interpersonal problems caused or ex acerbated by the effects of the substance (Cri-
terion 6). Important social, occupational, or re creational activities ma y be given up or re-
duced because of substance us e (Criterion 7). The individual may withdraw from family
activities and hobbies in order to use the substance. 
Risky use of the substance is the third grouping of criteria (Criteria 8–9). This may take
the form of recurrent substanc e use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (Cri-
terion 8). The individual may continue substance use despite knowledge of having a per-
sistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
exacerbated by the substance (Criterion 9). The key issue in evaluating this criterion is not
the existence of the problem, but rather the in dividual’s failure to abstain from using the
substance despite the difficulty it is causing.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,528
"484 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Pharmacological criteria are the final grouping (Criteria 10 and 11). Tolerance (Crite-
rion 10) is signaled by requiring a markedly in creased dose of the substance to achieve the
desired effect or a markedly reduced effect when the usual dose is consumed. The degree
to which tolerance develops varies greatly across different individuals as well as across
substances and may involve a va riety of central nervous system  effects. For example, tol-
erance to respiratory depression and tolerance to sedating and motor coordination may
develop at different rates, depending on the substance. Tolerance ma y be difficult to de-
termine by history alone, and la boratory tests may be helpful (e .g., high blood levels of the
substance coupled with little evidence of into xication suggest that tolerance is likely). Tol-
erance must also be distinguished from indi vidual variability in the initial sensitivity to
the effects of particular substances. For exam ple, some first-time alcohol drinkers show
very little evidence of intoxication with thre e or four drinks, whereas others of similar
weight and drinking histories have slurred speech and incoordination. 
Withdrawal (Criterion 11) is a syndrome th at occurs when blood or tissue concentra-
tions of a substance decline in an individual who had maintained prolonged heavy use of
the substance. After developi ng withdrawal symptoms, the individual is likely to con-
sume the substance to relieve the symptoms . Withdrawal symptoms vary greatly across
the classes of substances, and separate criter ia sets for withdrawal are provided for the
drug classes. Marked and generally easily me asured physiological signs of withdrawal are
common with alcohol, opioids, and sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics. Withdrawal
signs and symptoms with stimulants (amphetamines and cocaine), as well as tobacco and
cannabis, are often present but may be le ss apparent. Significant withdrawal has not been
documented in humans after repeated use of  phencyclidine, other hallucinogens, and in-
halants; therefore, this criterion is not incl uded for these substances. Neither tolerance nor
withdrawal is necessary for a diagnosis of a substance use disorder. However, for most
classes of substances, a past history of withdraw al is associated with a more severe clinical
course (i.e., an earlier onset of a substance us e disorder, higher levels of substance intake,
and a greater number of substance-related problems)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,529
"Symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal occurring during appropriate medical treat-
ment with prescribed medications (e.g., opio id analgesics, sedatives, stimulants) are spe-
cifically not counted when diagnosing a substance use disorder. The appearance of normal,
expected pharmacological  tolerance and withdrawal during the course of medical treat-
ment has been known to lead to an erroneou s diagnosis of “addiction” even when these
were the only symptoms pr esent. Indivi duals whose only symptoms are those that occur
as a result of medical treatment (i.e., tolera nce and withdrawal as part of medical care
when the medications are taken as prescribed) sh ould not receive a diagnosis solely on the
basis of these symptoms. However, prescripti on medications can be used inappropriately,
and a substance use disorder can be correc tly diagnosed when there are other symptoms
of compulsive, drug-seeking behavior",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,529
"Severity and Specifiers
Substance use disorders occur in a broad range of severity, from mild  to severe, with se-
verity based on the number of symptom criteria endorsed. As a general estimate of sever-
ity, a mild substance use disorder is suggested by the presence of two to three symptoms,
moderate  by four to five symptoms, and severe by six or more symptoms. Changing severity
across time is also reflected by reductions or increases in the fr equency and/or dose of
substance use, as assessed by the individual’s  own report, report of knowledgeable others,
clinician’s observations, and biological testing. The following course specifiers and descrip-
tive features specifiers are a lso available for substance use di sorders: “in early remission,”
“in sustained remission,” “on maintenance th erapy,” and “in a cont rolled environment.”
Definitions of each are provided within respective criteria sets. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,529
"Substance Use Disorders 485
Recording Procedures for Substance Use Disorders
The clinician should use the code that applies to the class of substances but record the
name of the specific substance.  For example, the clinician should record 304.10 (F13.20)
moderate alprazolam use disorder  (rather than moderate seda tive, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder) or 305.70 (F15.10) mild methamphetamine use disorder (rather than mild
stimulant use disorder). For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., anabolic
steroids), the appropriate code for “other su bstance use disorder” should be used and the
specific substance indicated (e.g., 305.90 [F19.10] mild anabolic steroid use disorder). If the
substance taken by the individual is unknown, the code for the class “other (or unknown)”
should be used (e.g., 304.90 [F 19.20] severe unknown substance use disorder). If criteria
are met for more than one substance use diso rder, all should be diagnosed (e.g., 304.00
[F11.20] severe heroin use disorder; 304.20 [F14.20] moderate cocaine use disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,530
"The appropriate ICD-10-CM code for a subs tance use disorder depends on whether
there is a comorbid substance-induced disorder  (including intoxication and withdrawal). In
the above example, the diagnostic code for moderate alprazolam use disorder, F13.20, re-
flects the absence of a comorbid alprazolam -induced mental disorder. Because ICD-10-CM
codes for substance-induced disorders indicate both the presence (or absence) and severity
of the substance use disorder, ICD-10-CM co des for substance use disorders can be used
only in the absence of a substance-induced di sorder. See the individu al substance-specific
sections for additional coding information",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,530
"Note that the word addiction  is not applied as a diagnostic term in this classification,
although it is in common usage in many countr ies to describe severe problems related to
compulsive and habitual use of substances. The more neutral term substance use disorder  is
used to describe the wide range of the disorder , from a mild form to a severe state of chron-
ically relapsing, compulsive drug taking. So me clinicians will choose to use the word ad-
diction  to describe more extreme presentations, but the word is omitted from the official
DSM-5 substance use disorder diagnostic term inology because of its uncertain definition
and its potentially negative connotation. 
Substance-Induced Disorders
The overall category of subs tance-induced disorders includ es intoxication, withdrawal,
and other substance/medication-induced ment al disorders (e.g., substance-induced psy-
chotic disorder, substance-in duced depressive disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,530
"Substance Intoxication and Withdrawal
Criteria for substance intoxica tion are included within the substance-specific sections of
this chapter. The essential fe ature is the development of a reversible substance-specific
syndrome due to the recent ingestion of a subs tance (Criterion A). The clinically significant
problematic behavioral or psychological changes associated with intoxication (e.g., bellig-
erence, mood lability, impaired judgment) are attributable to the phy siological effects of
the substance on the central nervous system and develop during or shortly after use of the
substance (Criterion B). The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition
and are not better explained by another mental  disorder (Criterion D). Substance intoxi-
cation is common among those with a substance use disorder but also occurs frequently in
individuals without a substance use disorder. This category does not apply to tobacco. 
The most common changes in intoxication involve disturba nces of perception, wake-
fulness, attention, thinking, judgment, psychomotor behavi or, and interpersonal behav-
ior. Short-term, or “acute,” intoxications may have different signs and symptoms than",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,530
"486 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
sustained, or “chronic,” intoxications. For example, moderate cocaine doses may initially
produce gregariousness, but social withdrawal  may develop if such doses are frequently
repeated over days or weeks",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,531
"When used in the physiological sense, the term intoxication  is broader than substance
intoxication as defined here. Many substances may produce physiological or psychologi-
cal changes that are not necessarily problematic. For example, an individual with tachy-
cardia from substance use has a physiological effe ct, but if this is the only symptom in the
absence of problematic behavior, the diagnosis of intoxication would not apply. Intoxica-
tion may sometimes persist beyond the time when the substance is detectable in the body",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,531
"This may be due to enduring central nervous system effects,  the recovery of which takes
longer than the time for elimination of the su bstance. These longer-term effects of intoxi-
cation must be distinguished from withdraw al (i.e., symptoms initiated by a decline in
blood or tissue concentrat ions of a substance)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,531
"Criteria for substance withdrawal are included within the su bstance-specific sections of
this chapter. The essential feat ure is the development of a subs tance-specific problematic be-
havioral change, with physiologic al and cognitive concomitants, that is due to the cessation of,
or reduction in, heavy and prolonged substance use (Criterion A). The substance-specific syn-
drome causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc cupational, or other im-
portant areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms are not due to another medical
condition and are not better explained by anot her mental disorder (Criterion D). Withdrawal
is usually, but not always, as sociated with a substance use disorder. Most individuals with
withdrawal have an urge to re-administe r the substance to reduce the symptoms. 
Route of Administration and Speed of Substance Effects
Routes of administration that produce more rapid and efficient absorption into the blood-
stream (e.g., intravenous, smoking, intranasal “snorting”) te nd to result in a more intense
intoxication and an increased likelihood of an escalating pattern of substance use leading
to withdrawal. Similarly, rapi dly acting substances are more likely than slower-acting
substances to produce immediate intoxication. 
Duration of Effects
Within the same drug category, relatively sh ort-acting substances tend to have a higher
potential for the development of withdrawal th an do those with a longer duration of ac-
tion. However, longer-acting substances tend to have longer withdrawal duration. The
half-life of the substance parallels aspects of wi thdrawal: the longer the duration of action,
the longer the time between cessation and th e onset of withdrawal symptoms and the lon-
ger the withdrawal duration. In general, the longer the acute withdrawal period, the less
intense the syndrome tends to be",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,531
"Use of Multiple Substances
Substance intoxication and withdrawal often involve several substances used simultane-
ously or sequentially. In these cases, each diagnosis should be recorded separately",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,531
"Associated Laboratory Findings
Laboratory analyses of blood and urine samples can help determine recent use and the specific
substances involved. However, a positive laboratory test result do es not by itself indicate that
the individual has a pattern of substance use that  meets criteria for a substance-induced or sub-
stance use disorder, and a negative test result does not by  itself rule out a diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,531
"Laboratory tests can be useful in identify ing withdrawal. If the individual presents
with withdrawal from an unknown substance, laboratory tests may help identify the sub-
stance and may also be helpful in differentiating withdrawal from other mental disorders.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,531
"Substance-Induced Disorders 487
In addition, normal functionin g in the presence of high bl ood levels of a substance sug-
gests considerable tolerance",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,532
"Development and Course
Individuals ages 18–24 years have relatively hi gh prevalence rates for the use of virtually
every substance. Intoxication is usually the initial substance-related disorder and often be-
gins in the teens. Withdrawal can occur at any age as long as the relevant drug has been
taken in sufficient doses over an extended period of time. 
Recording Procedures for Intoxication and Withdrawal
The clinician should use the code that applies to the class of substances but record the
name of the specific substance.  For example, the clinician sh ould record 292. 0 (F13.239) seco-
barbital withdrawal (rather than sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal) or 292.89
(F15.129) methamphetamine intoxication (rathe r than stimulant intoxication). Note that
the appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnostic code fo r intoxication depends on whether there is
a comorbid substance use diso rder. In this case, the F15.129 code for methamphetamine in-
dicates the presence of a comorbid mild methamphetamine use disorder. If there had been
no comorbid methamphetamine use disorder , the diagnostic code would have been
F15.929. ICD-10-CM coding rules require th at all withdrawal codes imply a comorbid
moderate to severe substance use disorder fo r that substance. In the above case, the code
for secobarbital withdrawal (F13.239) indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate to se-
vere secobarbital use disorder . See the coding note for the substance-specific intoxication
and withdrawal syndromes for the actual coding options",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,532
"For substances that do not fit into any of the cl asses (e.g., anabolic steroids), the appropriate
code for “other substance intoxication” should be used and the specific substance indicated
(e.g., 292.89 [F19.929] anabolic steroid intoxication). If the substance taken by the individual is
unknown, the code for the class “other (or unknown)” should be used (e.g., 292.89 [F19.929]
unknown substance intoxication). If there are sy mptoms or problems associated with a partic-
ular substance but criteria are not met for any of  the substance-specific disorders, the unspec-
ified category can be used (e.g., 292.9 [F12.99] unspecified cannabis-related disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,532
"As noted above, the substance-related codes in ICD-10-CM combine the substance use dis-
order aspect of the clinical picture and the su bstance-induced aspect into a single combined
code. Thus, if both heroin withdrawal and modera te heroin use disorder are present, the single
code F11.23 is given to cover both presentati ons. In ICD-9-CM, separate diagnostic codes
(292.0 and 304.00) are given to indicate withdr awal and a moderate heroin use disorder, re-
spectively. See the individual substance-specific  sections for additional coding information. 
Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders
The substance/medication-induced mental di sorders are potentially severe, usually tem-
porary, but sometimes persisti ng central nervous system (C NS) syndromes that develop
in the context of the effects of substances of abuse, medications, or several toxins. They are
distinguished from the substance use disorder s, in which a cluster of cognitive, behav-
ioral, and physiological symptoms contribute to the continued use of a substance despite
significant substance-related problems. The substance/medication-induced mental disor-
ders may be induced by the 10 classes of subs tances that produce su bstance use disorders,
or by a great variety of other medications used in medical treatment. Each substance-
induced mental disorder is desc ribed in the relevant chapter (e.g., “Depressive Disorders,”
“Neurocognitive Disorders”), an d therefore, only a brief description is offered here. All
substance/medication-induced disorders share common characte ristics. It is important to
recognize these common features to aid in th e detection of these disorders. These features
are described as follows:",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,532

order could include the following:
1. The disorder preceded the onset of severe  intoxication or withdrawal or exposure
to the medication; or
2. The full mental disorder persisted for a substa ntial period of time (e.g., at least 1 month)
after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication or taking the medica-
tion. This criterion does not apply to su bstance-induced neurocognitive disorders

"Features
Some generalizations can be made  regarding the categories of substances capable of produc-
ing clinically relevant substance-induced mental disorders. In general, the more sedating
drugs (sedative, hypnotics, or anxiolytics, and alcohol) can produce prominent and clini-
cally significant depressive disorders during in toxication, while anxiet y conditions are likely
to be observed during withdrawal syndromes from these substances. Also, during intoxica-
tion, the more stimulating substances (e.g., am phetamines and cocaine) are likely to be as-
sociated with substance-induced psychoti c disorders and substance-induced anxiety
disorders, with substance-indu ced major depressive episodes observed during withdrawal",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,533
"Both the more sedating and mo re stimulating drugs are likely to produce significant but
temporary sleep and sexual dist urbances. An overview of the relationship between specific
categories of substanc es and specific psychiatric syndromes is presented in Table 1",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,533
"The medication-induced conditions includ e what are often idiosyncratic CNS reac-
tions or relatively extreme examples of side effects for a wide range of medications taken
for a variety of medical concerns. These includ e neurocognitive complications of anesthet-
ics, antihistamines, antihypertensives, and a variety of other medications and toxins (e.g.,
organophosphates, insecticides, carbon monoxi de), as described in the chapter on neuro-
cognitive disorders. Psychotic syndromes may be temporarily experienced in the context
of anticholinergic, cardiovascul ar, and steroid drugs, as well  as during use of stimulant-
like and depressant-like prescription or over-the-counter drugs. Temporary but severe
mood disturbances can be observed with a wi de range of medications, including steroids,
antihypertensives, disulfiram, and any prescription or over-the- counter depressant or
stimulant-like substances. A similar range of medications can be associated with tempo-
rary anxiety syndromes, sexual dysfunct ions, and conditions of disturbed sleep",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,533
"In general, to be considered a substance/ medication-induced mental disorder, there
must be evidence that the diso rder being observed is not likely to be better explained by an
independent mental condition. The latter are most likely to be seen if the mental disorder
was present before the severe intoxication or withdrawal or medication administration, or,
with the exception of several substance-induced persisting disorders listed in Table 1, con-
tinued more than 1 month after cessation of acute withdrawal, severe intoxication, or use",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,533
"Substance-Induced Disorders 489
of the medications. When symptoms are only  observed during a delirium (e.g., alcohol
withdrawal delirium), the mental disorder sh ould be diagnosed as a delirium, and the
psychiatric syndrome occurring during the delirium should not also be diagnosed sepa-
rately, as many symptoms (including disturba nces in mood, anxiety, and reality testing)
are commonly seen during agitated, confused states. The features associated with each rel-
evant major mental disorder are similar whether observed with independent or sub-
stance/medication-induced mental disorders. However, individuals with substance/
medication-induced mental disorders are lik ely to also demonstrate the associated fea-
tures seen with the specific category of subs tance or medication, as listed in other subsec-
tions of this chapter. 
Development and Course
Substance-induced mental disord ers develop in the context of  intoxication or withdrawal
from substances of abuse, and medication-i nduced mental disorders are seen with pre-
scribed or over-the-counter medications that are taken at the suggest ed doses. Both condi-
tions are usually temporary and li kely to disappear with in 1 month or so of cessation of acute
withdrawal, severe intoxication, or use of th e medication. Exceptions to these generaliza-
tions occur for certain long-d uration substance-in duced disorders: substance-associated
neurocognitive disorders that relate to conditions such as alcohol- induced neurocognitive
disorder, inhalant-induced neurocognitive disord er, and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-
induced neurocognitive disorder; and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (“flash-
backs”; see the section “Hallucinogen-Related Disorders” later in this chapter). However,
most other substance/medication -induced mental disorders, re gardless of the severity of
the symptoms, are likely to impr ove relatively quickly with ab stinence and unlikely to re-
main clinically relevant for more than 1 month after complete cessation of use",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,534
"As is true of many consequences of heavy substance use, some individuals are more
and others less prone toward specific substance-induced disorders. Similar types of pre-
dispositions may make some individuals more likely to develop psychiatric side effects of
some types of medications, but not others. However, it is unclear whether individuals
with family histories or personal prior hist ories with independent psychiatric syndromes
are more likely to develop the induced synd rome once the consideration is made as to
whether the quantity and frequency of the substance was sufficient to lead to the devel-
opment of a substanc e-induced syndrome",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,534
"There are indications that the intake of su bstances of abuse or some medications with
psychiatric side effects in the context of a pree xisting mental disorder is likely to result in
an intensification of the preexisting indepe ndent syndrome. The risk for substance/med-
ication-induced mental disorders is likely to increase with both the quantity and the fre-
quency of consumption of  the relevant substance",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,534
"The symptom profiles for the substance/medication-induced mental disorders resem-
ble independent mental disorders. While the symptoms of substance/medication-in-
duced mental disorders can be identical to those of independent mental disorders (e.g.,
delusions, hallucinations, psychoses, major de pressive episodes, anxiety syndromes), and
although they can have the same severe conseq uences (e.g., suicide) , most induced mental
disorders are likely to improve in a matt er of days to weeks of abstinence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,534
"The substance/medication-induced mental di sorders are an important part of the dif-
ferential diagnoses for the independent psychiatric conditions. The importance of recog-

Coding notes and separate recording procedures for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for
other specific substance/medi cation-induced mental diso rders are provided in other
chapters of the manual with disorders with  which they share phenomenology (see the sub-
stance/medication-indu ced mental disorders in these chapters: “Schizophrenia Spectrum
and Other Psychotic Disorders,” “Bipolar and Related Disorders,” “Depressive Disor-

for ICD-9-CM, if a mental disorder is induced by a substance use disorder, a separate di-
agnostic code is given for the specific substance use disorder, in addition  to the code for the
substance/medication-induced mental disord er. For ICD-10-CM, a single code combines
the substance-induced mental disorder with the substance use disorder. A separate diag-
nosis of the comorbid substance use disorder is  not given, although the name and severity
of the specific substance use disorder (whe n present) are used when recording the sub-
stance/medication-induced mental disorder. ICD-10-CM codes are also provided for sit-
uations in which the substance/ medication-induced mental di sorder is not induced by a
substance use disorder (e.g., when a disorder is induced by one-time use of a substance or
medication). Additional  information needed to record the diagnostic name of the sub-

Specifiers
“In a controlled environment” app lies as a further specifier of remission if the individual is

environment or in sustained remission in a controlled environmen t). Examples of these
environments are closely supe rvised and substanc e-free jails, therapeutic communities,
and locked hospital units. 
Severity of the disorder is based on the number of diagno stic criteria endorsed. For a
given individual, changes in severity of alcoho l use disorder across ti me are also reflected
by reductions in the frequency (e.g., days of  use per month) and/or dose (e.g., number of
standard drinks consumed per day) of alcohol used, as assessed by the individual’s self-
report, report of knowledgeabl e others, clinician observations, and, when practical, bio-
logical testing (e.g., elevations in blood test s as described in the section “Diagnostic Mark-
ers” for this disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,537
"Diagnostic Features
Alcohol use disorder is defined by a cluste r of behavioral and physical symptoms, which
can include withdrawal, tolerance, and cravin g. Alcohol withdrawal  is characterized by
withdrawal symptoms that de velop approximately 4–12 hours after the reduction of in-
take following prolonged, heavy alcohol inge stion. Because withdrawal from alcohol can
be unpleasant and intense, individuals may continue to consume alcohol despite adverse
consequences, often to avoid or to relieve withdrawal symptoms. Some withdrawal symp-
toms (e.g., sleep problems) can persist at lower intensities for months and can contribute to
relapse. Once a pattern of re petitive and intense use develo ps, individuals with alcohol
use disorder may devote substantial periods of time to obtaining and consuming alcoholic
beverages. 
Craving for alcohol is indicated by a strong desire to drink that makes it difficult to
think of anything else and that often results in the onset of drinking. School and job per-
formance may also suffer either from the aftereffects of drinking or from actual intoxica-
tion at school or on the job; child care or household responsibilities may be neglected; and
alcohol-related absences may o ccur from school or work. The individual may use alcohol
in physically hazardous circumstances (e.g., driving an automobile, swimming, operating
machinery while intoxicated). Finally, individu als with an alcohol use disorder may con-
tinue to consume alco hol despite the knowledge that continued consumption poses sig-
nificant physical (e.g., blackouts, liver disease ), psychological (e.g., depression), social, or
interpersonal problems (e.g., violent argume nts with spouse while intoxicated, child
abuse)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,537
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Alcohol use disorder is often associated wi th problems similar to  those associated with
other substances (e.g., cannabis ; cocaine; heroin; amphetamin es; sedatives, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics). Alcohol may be used to alleviate the unwanted effects of these other
substances or to substitute for them when they are not av ailable. Symptoms of conduct
problems, depression, anxiety, and insomnia frequently accompany heavy drinking and
sometimes precede it. 
Repeated intake of high doses of alcohol can affect nearly every organ system, espe-
cially the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovasc ular system, and the central and peripheral ner-
vous systems. Gastrointestinal effects includ e gastritis, stomach or duodenal ulcers, and,
in about 15% of individuals who use alcohol he avily, liver cirrhosis and/or pancreatitis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,537

gastrointestinal tract. One of the most comm only associated conditions is low-grade hy-

increases in levels of triglycerides and low- density lipoprotein cholesterol, contribute to
an elevated risk of heart disease. Periphe ral neuropathy may be evidenced by muscular
weakness, paresthesias, and decreased peripher al sensation. More persistent central ner-
vous system effects include cognitive deficits, severe memory impairment, and degener-
ative changes in the cerebellum. These effects are related to the direct effects of alcohol or
of trauma and to vitamin deficiencies (parti cularly of the B vitamins, including thiamine)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,538

Alcohol use disorder is a common disorder. In  the United States, the 12-month prevalence
of alcohol use disorder is estimated to be 4.6% among 12- to 17-year-olds and 8.5% among
adults age 18 years and older in the United St ates. Rates of the disorder are greater among
adult men (12.4%) than among adult women (4 .9%). Twelve-month prevalence of alcohol
use disorder among adults decreases in midd le age, being greatest among individuals 18-
to 29-years-old (16.2%) and lowest among individuals age 65 years and older (1.5%)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,538

and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (4.5%)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,538
"Development and Course
The first episode of alcohol into xication is likely to occur during the mid-teens. Alcohol-
related problems that do not m eet full criteria for a use disord er or isolated problems may
occur prior to age 20 years, but the age at onse t of an alcohol use disorder with two or more
of the criteria clustered together peaks in th e late teens or early to mid 20s. The large ma-
jority of individuals who develop alcohol-relate d disorders do so by their late 30s. The first
evidence of withdrawal is not likely to appear until after many other aspects of an alcohol
use disorder have developed. An  earlier onset of alcohol use disorder is observed in ado-
lescents with preexisting conduct problems and those with an earlier onset of intoxication",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,538
"Alcohol use disorder has a variable course th at is characterized by periods of remission
and relapse. A decision to stop drinking, often in response to a crisis, is likely to be followed
by a period of weeks or more of abstinence , which is often followed by limited periods of
controlled or nonproblematic drinking. However,  once alcohol intake resumes, it is highly
likely that consumption will rapidly escalate and that severe problems will once again
develop",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,538
"Alcohol use disorder is often erroneously pe rceived as an intractable condition, per-
haps based on the fact that individuals who present for treatment typically have a history
of many years of severe alco hol-related problems. However, these most severe cases rep-
resent only a small proportion of individuals with this disorder, and the typical individual
with the disorder has a much more promising prognosis. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,538
"494 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Among adolescents, conduct disorder and repeated antisocial behavior often co-occur
with alcohol- and with other substance-relate d disorders. While most  individuals with al-
cohol use disorder develop the condition be fore age 40 years, perhaps 10% have later
onset. Age-related physical changes in older individuals result in increased brain suscep-
tibility to the depressant effect s of alcohol; decreased rates of  liver metabolism of a variety
of substances, including alcohol; and decrease d percentages of body water. These changes
can cause older people to develop more seve re intoxication and su bsequent problems at
lower levels of consumption. Al cohol-related problems in older people are also especially
likely to be associated with  other medical complications",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,539
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Environmental. Environmental risk and prognostic factors may include cultural atti-
tudes toward drinking and intoxication, the availability of alcohol (including price),
acquired personal experiences with alcohol, and stress levels. Additional potential medi-
ators of how alcohol problems develop in predisposed individuals include heavier peer
substance use, exaggerated positive expectations  of the effects of alcohol, and suboptimal
ways of coping with stress. 
Genetic and physiological. Alcohol use disorder runs in families, with 40%–60% of the
variance of risk explained by genetic influenc es. The rate of this condition is three to four
times higher in close relatives of individuals with alcohol use disorder, with values highest
for individuals with a greater nu mber of affected relatives, closer genetic relationships to
the affected person, and higher severity of the alcohol-related problems in those relatives",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,539
"A significantly higher rate of alcohol use disorders exists in the monozygotic twin than in
the dizygotic twin of an individual with the condition. A three- to fourfold increase in risk
has been observed in children of individuals with alcohol use disorder, even when these
children were given up for adoption at birth and raised by adoptive parents who did not
have the disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,539
"Recent advances in our understanding of  genes that operate through intermediate
characteristics (or phe notypes) to affect the risk of alco hol use disorder can help to identify
individuals who might be at pa rticularly low or high risk for alcohol use disorder. Among
the low-risk phenotypes are the acute alcohol-related skin flush (seen most prominently in
Asians). High vulnerability is associated with  preexisting schizophrenia or bipolar disor-
der, as well as impulsivity (producing enha nced rates of all substance use disorders and
gambling disorder), and a high risk specifically for alcohol use disorder is associated with
a low level of response (low sensitivity) to alcohol. A number of gene variations may ac-
count for low response to alcohol or modulate the dopamine reward systems; it is impor-
tant to note, however, that any one gene variat ion is likely to explain only 1%–2% of the risk
for these disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,539
"Course modifiers. In general, high levels of impulsivity are associated with an earlier
onset and more severe alcohol use disorder. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
In most cultures, alcohol is the most frequently used intoxicating substance and contrib-
utes to considerable morbidity and mortality. An estimate d 3.8% of all global deaths and
4.6% of global disability-adjusted life-years are attribut able to alcohol. In the United States,
80% of adults (age 18 years and older) have co nsumed alcohol at some  time in their lives,
and 65% are current drinkers (last 12 months).  An estimated 3.6% of the world population
(15–64 years old) has a current (12-month) alcohol use disorder, with a lower prevalence
(1.1%) found in the Afri can region, a higher rate  (5.2%) found in the Am erican region (North,
South, and Central America and the Caribbean) , and the highest rate (10.9%) found in the
Eastern Europe region.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,539
"Alcohol Use Disorder 495
Polymorphisms of genes for the alcohol- metabolizing enzymes alcohol dehydroge-
nase and aldehyde dehydrogenase are most ofte n seen in Asians and affect the response to
alcohol. When consuming alcoho l, individuals with these gene variations can experience a
flushed face and palpitations, reactions that ca n be so severe as to lim it or preclude future
alcohol consumption and diminish the risk fo r alcohol use disorder. These gene variations
are seen in as many as 40% of Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and related groups worldwide
and are related to lower risks for the disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,540
"Despite small variations regarding individual criterion items, the diagnostic criteria
perform equally well across mo st race/ethnicity groups",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,540
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Males have higher rates of drinking and rela ted disorders than fema les. However, because
females generally weigh less than males, have more fat and less water in their bodies, and
metabolize less alcohol in their esophagus and stomach, they are likely to develop higher
blood alcohol levels per drink than males. Females who drink heavily may also be more
vulnerable than males to some of the physical consequences associated with alcohol, in-
cluding liver disease",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,540
"Diagnostic Markers
Individuals whose heavier drinking places them  at elevated risk for alcohol use disorder
can be identified both through standardized qu estionnaires and by elevations in blood test
results likely to be seen with regular heavie r drinking. These measures do not establish a
diagnosis of an alcohol-related disorder but can be useful in highlighting individuals for
whom more information should be gathered. Th e most direct test available to measure al-
cohol consumption cross-sectionally is blood alcohol concentration,  which can also be used to
judge tolerance to alcohol. For example, an individual with a conc entration of 150 mg of
ethanol per deciliter (dL) of blood who does not show signs of intoxication can be pre-
sumed to have acquired at le ast some degree of tolerance to  alcohol. At 200 mg/dL, most
nontolerant individuals demons trate severe intoxication. 
Regarding laboratory tests, one sensitive la boratory indicator of heavy drinking is a
modest elevation or high-normal levels (>35  units) of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,540
"This may be the only laboratory  finding. At least 70% of indi viduals with a high GGT level
are persistent heavy drinkers (i.e., consuming ei ght or more drinks daily on a regular basis)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,540
"A second test with comparable or even higher levels of sensitivity and specificity is carbo-
hydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT), with levels of  20 units or higher us eful in identifying in-
dividuals who regularly consum e eight or more drinks daily. Since both GGT and CDT
levels return toward normal within days to weeks of stopping drinking, both state markers
may be useful in monitoring abstinence, espe cially when the clinician observes increases,
rather than decreases, in thes e values over time—a finding indicating that the person is
likely to have returned to heavy drinking. The combination of tests for CDT and GGT may
have even higher levels of sens itivity and specificity than eith er test used alone. Additional
useful tests include the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), whic h may be elevated to high-
normal values in individuals who drink heavily— a change that is due to the direct toxic ef-
fects of alcohol on erythropoiesis. Although the MCV can be used  to help identify those who
drink heavily, it is a poor method of monitori ng abstinence because of the long half-life of
red blood cells. Liver function tests (e.g., alanine aminotransfe rase [ALT] and alkaline phos-
phatase) can reveal liver injury that is a co nsequence of heavy drinking. Other potential
markers of heavy drinking that are more nons pecific for alcohol but can help the clinician
think of the possible effects of alcohol include elevations in blood levels or lipids (e.g., tri-
glycerides and high-density li poprotein cholesterol) and high -normal levels of uric acid",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,540

ing can accompany gastritis, and hepatomegaly, esophageal varices, and hemorrhoids may
reflect alcohol-induced changes in the liver. Other physical signs of heavy drinking include
tremor, unsteady gait, insomnia, and erectile dy sfunction. Males with chronic alcohol use dis-
order may exhibit decreased testicular size and feminizing effects associated with reduced
testosterone levels. Repeated he avy drinking in females is associated with menstrual irregu-
larities and, during pregnancy, spontaneous abortion and fetal alcohol syndrome. Individu-
als with preexisting histories of epilepsy or se vere head trauma are more likely to develop
alcohol-related seizures. Alcohol withdrawal ma y be associated with nausea, vomiting, gas-
tritis, hematemesis, dry mouth, puffy blot chy complexion, and mild peripheral edema",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,541
"Functional Consequences of Alcohol Use Disorder
The diagnostic features of alcohol use disord er highlight major area s of life functioning
likely to be impaired. These include driving and operating machinery, school and work,
interpersonal relationships and communication, and health. Alcoho l-related disorders
contribute to absenteeism from work, job-re lated accidents, and low employee productiv-
ity. Rates are elevated in homeless individual s, perhaps reflecting a downward spiral in
social and occupational functioning, although most individuals with alcohol use disorder
continue to live with their families and function within their jobs",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,541

perience an alcohol-related adverse event at so me time in their lives, with alcohol account-
ing for up to 55% of fatal driving events. Severe alcohol use disorder, especially in
individuals with antisocial personality disorder, is associated with the commission of
criminal acts, including homicide. Severe problematic alcohol use also contributes to dis-

heavy doses of alcohol with resulting repeated and significant distress or impaired func-
tioning. While most drinkers sometimes consume enough alcohol to feel intoxicated, only

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of alcohol intoxication is the presence of  clinically significant problematic
behavioral or psychological chan ges (e.g., inappropriate sexual  or aggressive behavior, mood
lability, impaired judgment, impaired social or occupational functioning) that develop during,
or shortly after, alcohol ingestion (Criterion B). These changes are accompanied by evidence of
impaired functioning and ju dgment and, if intoxication is inte nse, can result in a life-threaten-
ing coma. The symptoms must not be attributable  to another medical co ndition (e.g., diabetic
ketoacidosis), are not a reflection  of conditions such as delirium,  and are not related to intoxi-
cation with other depressant drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) (Crite rion D). The levels of incoor-
dination can interfere with driving abilities and performance of usual activities to the point of
causing accidents. Evidence of alcohol use can be  obtained by smelling alcohol on the individ-
ual’s breath, eliciting a history from the indivi dual or another observer, and, when needed,
having the individual provide breath, blood , or urine samples for toxicology analyses",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,542

Alcohol intoxication is sometimes associated with amnesia for the events that occurred
during the course of the intoxication (“bl ackouts”). This phenomenon may be related to
the presence of a high blood alcohol level an d, perhaps, to the rapidity with which this
level is reached. During even mild alcohol in toxication, different symptoms are likely to be",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,542

observed at different time points. Evidence of mild intoxication with alcohol can be seen in
most individuals after approximately two drin ks (each standard drink is approximately
10–12 grams of ethanol and raises the blood alcohol concentration approximately 20 mg/
dL). Early in the drinking period, when blood alcohol levels are rising, symptoms often
include talkativeness, a sensation of well-being, and a bright, expansive mood. Later, es-
pecially when blood alcohol levels are falling,  the individual is likely to become progres-
sively more depressed,  withdrawn, and cognitively impair ed. At very high blood alcohol
levels (e.g., 200–300 mg/dL), an individual who has not developed tolerance for alcohol is
likely to fall asleep and enter a first stage of anesthesia. Higher blood alcohol levels (e.g., in
excess of 300–400 mg/dL) can cause inhibition of respiration and pulse and even death in
nontolerant individuals. The duration of in toxication depends on how much alcohol was
consumed over what period of time. In general, the body is able to metabolize approxi-
mately one drink per hour, so that the blood alcohol level generally decreases at a rate of
15–20 mg/dL per hour. Signs and symptoms of in toxication are likely to be more intense
when the blood alcohol level is rising than when it is falling",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,543

"Functional Consequences of Alcohol Intoxication
Alcohol intoxication contributes to the more than 30,000 alcohol-related drinking deaths in

arguments and physical fights",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,544
"Differential Diagnosis
Other medical conditions. Several medical (e.g., diabetic acidosis) and neurological condi-

Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication. Intoxication with se dative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic drugs or with other sedating subs tances (e.g., antihistam ines, anticholinergic
drugs) can be mistaken for alcohol intoxicati on. The differential requires observing alco-
hol on the breath, measuring blood or breath alcohol levels , ordering a medical workup,
and gathering a good history. The signs and symptoms of sedative-hypnotic intoxication
are very similar to those observed with alco hol and include similar problematic behavioral
or psychological changes. These changes are accompanied by evidence of impaired func-
tioning and judgment—which, if intense, can result in a life-threat ening coma—and levels
of incoordination that can interfere with driving abilities and with performing usual
activities. However, there is no smell as there is with alcohol, but there is likely to be evi-

Although confusion and changes in consciousness are not core criteria for alcohol with-
drawal, alcohol withdrawal delirium (see “De lirium” in the chapte r “Neurocognitive Dis-

regardless of the cause, in addition to a disturbance of cons ciousness and cognition, with-
drawal delirium can include visual, tactile, or (rarely) auditory hallucinations (delirium tre-
mens). When alcohol withdrawal delirium develo ps, it is likely that a clinically relevant

Prevalence
It is estimated that approximately 50% of mi ddle-class, highly functional individuals with

individuals with alcohol use disorder who are hospitalized or homeless, the rate of al-
cohol withdrawal may be greater than 80%. Less than 10% of individuals in withdrawal
ever demonstrate alcoho l withdrawal delirium or withdrawal seizures. 
Development and Course
Acute alcohol withdrawal occurs as an episode usually lasting 4–5 days and only after
extended periods of heavy drinking. Withdrawal  is relatively rare in individuals younger
than 30 years, and the risk and seve rity increase with increasing age",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,546
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Environmental. The probability of developing alco hol withdrawal increases with the
quantity and frequency of alcohol consumptio n. Most individuals with this condition are
drinking daily, consuming large amounts (appr oximately more than eight drinks per day)
for multiple days. However, there are large inter-individual differences, with enhanced
risks for individuals with concurrent medical conditions, those with family histories of al-
cohol withdrawal (i.e., a gene tic component), those with pr ior withdrawals, and individ-
uals who consume sedative, hy pnotic, or anxiolytic drugs",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,546

"Functional Consequences  of Alcohol Withdrawal
Symptoms of withdrawal may serve to perpet uate drinking behaviors and contribute to
relapse, resulting in persistently impaired so cial and occupational functioning. Symptoms
requiring medically supervised detoxification result in hospital utilization and loss of
work productivity. Overall, the presence of withdrawal is associated with greater func-
tional impairment and poor prognosis. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other medical conditions. The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal can also be mimicked
by some medical conditions (e.g., hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis). Essential
tremor, a disorder that frequently runs in  families, may erroneou sly suggest the tremu-
lousness associated with alcohol withdrawal.

Other Alcohol-Induced Disorders
The following alcohol-induced disorders are desc ribed in other chapters of the manual with
disorders with which they share phenomenol ogy (see the substance/medication-induced
mental disorders in these chapters): alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophrenia Spec-
trum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); alcoho l-induced bipolar diso rder (“Bipolar and
Related Disorders”); alcohol-induced depressive  disorder (“Depressive  Disorders”); alcohol-
induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disorders”); alcohol-induced sl eep disorder (“Sleep-
Wake Disorders”); alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction (“Sexual Dysfunctions”); and alcohol-
induced major or mild neurocognitive disorder (“Neurocognitive Disorders”). For alcohol
intoxication delirium an d alcohol withdrawal delirium, see th e criteria and discussion of de-
lirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Disorder s.” These alcohol-induced disorders are diag-
nosed instead of alcohol intoxication or alcohol withdrawal only when the symptoms are
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,547
"Features
The symptom profiles for an al cohol-induced condition resemble independent mental disor-
ders as described elsewhere in  DSM-5. However, the alcohol- induced disorder is temporary
and observed after severe intoxication with an d/or withdrawal from alcohol. While the symp-
toms can be identical to those of independent mental disorders (e.g., psychoses, major depres-
sive disorder), and while they can have the same  severe consequences (e.g., suicide attempts),
alcohol-induced conditions are li kely to improve without formal treatment in a matter of days
to weeks after cessation of severe intoxication and/or withdrawal. 
Each alcohol-induced mental disorder is listed  in the relevant diagnostic section and there-
fore only a brief description is offered here. Alcohol-induced disorder s must have developed
in the context of severe intoxication and/or wi thdrawal from the substance capable of produc-
ing the mental disorder. In addition, there must  be evidence that the disorder being observed
is not likely to be better expl ained by another non-alcohol-indu ced mental disorder. The latter
is likely to occur if the mental  disorder was present before the severe intoxication or with-
drawal, or continued more than 1 month after the cessation of severe intoxication and/or with-
drawal. When symptoms are observed only during a delirium, they should be considered part
of the delirium and not diagnosed separately, as  many symptoms (including disturbances in
mood, anxiety, and reality testin g) are commonly seen during ag itated, confused states. The al-
cohol-induced disorder must be clinically relevant, causing significant levels of distress or sig-
nificant functional impairment. Finally, there are indications that the intake of substances of
abuse in the context of a preexisting mental disorder are likely to result in an intensification of
the preexisting independent syndrome. 
The features associated with each relevant  major mental disorder (e.g., psychotic epi-
sodes, major depressive disorder) are similar whether observed with an independent or an
alcohol-induced condition. However, indivi duals with alcohol-induced disorders are
likely to also demonstrate the associated feat ures seen with an alcohol use disorder, as
listed in the subsections of this chapter",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,547
"Rates of alcohol-induced diso rders vary somewhat by diag nostic category. For exam-
ple, the lifetime risk for major depressive epis odes in individuals with alcohol use disorder
is approximately 40%, but only about one-third to one-half of these represent independent
major depressive syndromes observed outside the context of intoxication. Similar rates of
alcohol-induced sleep and anxiet y conditions are likely, but alcohol-induced psychotic ep-
isodes are fairly rare. 
Development and Course
Once present, the symptoms of an alcohol-in duced condition are likely to remain clinically
relevant as long as the individual continues to  experience severe intoxication and/or with-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,547

drawal. While the symptoms are identical to those of independent mental disorders (e.g.,
psychoses, major depressive disorder), and while they can have the same severe conse-
quences (e.g., suicide attempts), all alcohol-induced syndromes other than alcohol-
induced neurocognitive disord er, amnestic confabulatory ty pe (alcohol-induced persist-
ing amnestic disorder), regardless of the se verity of the symptoms, are likely to improve
relatively quickly and unlikely to remain clin ically relevant for more than 1 month after
cessation of severe intoxication and/or withdrawal. 
The alcohol-induced disorders are an important part of the differential diagnoses for
the independent mental conditions. Independ ent schizophrenia, major depressive disor-
der, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders, su ch as panic disorder, are likely to be asso-
ciated with much longer-lasting periods of symptoms and often require longer-term
medications to optimize the probability of improvement or recovery . The alcohol-induced
conditions, on the other hand, are likely to be much shorter in duration and disappear
within several days to 1 month after cessatio n of severe intoxication and/or withdrawal,
even without psychotropic medications. 
The importance of recognizing an alcohol- induced disorder is similar to the relevance
of identifying the possible role of some endo crine conditions and medication reactions be-
fore diagnosing an independent mental disorder. In light of the high prevalence of alcohol
use disorders worldwide, it is important that these alcohol- induced diagnoses be consid-
ered before independent ment al disorders are diagnosed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,548

Impairment from caffeine intoxication may have serious consequences, including dys-

precipitate a caffeine-induced disorder. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other mental disorders. Caffeine intoxication may be characterized by symptoms (e.g.,
panic attacks) that resemble primary mental diso rders. To meet criteria for caffeine intoxica-
tion, the symptoms must not be associated with another medical condition or another mental
disorder, such as an anxiety di sorder, that could better expl ain them. Manic episodes; panic
disorder; generalized anxiety disorder; amphetami ne intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anx-
iolytic withdrawal or tobacco withdrawal; slee p disorders; and medication-induced side ef-
fects (e.g., akathisia) can cause a clinical picture that is similar to that of caffeine intoxication. 
Other caffeine-induced disorders. The temporal relationship of the symptoms to increased
caffeine use or to abstinence from caffeine help s to establish the diagno sis. Caffeine intoxica-
tion is differentiated from caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication
(see “Substance/Medicat ion-Induced Anxiety Disorder” in the chapter “Anxiety Disorders”),
and caffeine-induced sleep disorder, with onse t during intoxication (see “Substance/Medica-
tion-Induced Sleep Disorder” in the chapter “S leep-Wake Disorders”), by the fact that the

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of caffeine withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic withdrawal
syndrome that develops after the abrupt cessation of (or substantial reduction in) pro-
longed daily caffeine ingestion (Criterion B) . The caffeine withdrawal syndrome is indi-
cated by three or more of the following (Criterion B): headache; marked fatigue or
drowsiness; dysphoric mood, depressed mood, or irritability; difficulty concentrating;
and flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or muscle pain/stiffness). The withdrawal syn-
drome causes clinical significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning (Criterion C) . The symptoms must not be associated with
the physiological effects of another medical co ndition and are not better explained by an-
other mental disorder (Criterion D). 
Headache is the hallmark feature of caffeine withdrawal and may be diffuse, gradual
in development, throbbing, severe, and sensitive to move ment. However, other symptoms
of caffeine withdrawal can occur in the abse nce of headache. Caffeine is the most widely
used behaviorally active drug in the world and is present in many different types of bev-
erages (e.g., coffee, tea, maté, soft drinks, energy drinks), foods, energy aids, medications,
and dietary supplements. Because caffeine ingestion is often integrated into social customs
and daily rituals (e.g., coffee break, tea time ), some caffeine consumers may be unaware of
their physical dependence on caffeine. Thus, caffeine withdrawal symptoms could be un-
expected and misattributed to other causes (e.g ., the flu, migraine). Furthermore, caffeine
withdrawal symptoms may occur when indivi duals are required to abstain from foods
and beverages prior to medical procedures or  when a usual caffeine dose is missed be-
cause of a change in routine (e.g., during travel, weekends).",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,551

Caffeine abstinence has been shown to be as sociated with impaired behavioral and cogni-

"Prevalence
More than 85% of adults and children in th e United States regularly consume caffeine,
with adult caffeine consumers ingesting abou t 280 mg/day on average. The incidence and
prevalence of the caffeine withdrawal syndro me in the general population are unclear. In
the United States, headache may occur in a pproximately 50% of cases of caffeine absti-
nence. In attempts to permanently stop caffein e use, more than 70% of individuals may ex-
perience at least one caffeine withdrawal sy mptom (47% may experience headache), and
24% may experience headache plus one or more other symptoms as well as functional
impairment due to withdrawal. Among individu als who abstain from caffeine for at least
24 hours but are not trying to permanently stop caffeine use, 11% may experience head-
ache plus one or more other symptoms as well as functional impairment. Caffeine con-
sumers can decrease the incidence of caffeine withdrawal by using ca ffeine daily or only
infrequently (e.g., no more than 2 consecutive days). Gradual reductio n in caffeine over a
period of days or weeks may decrease the incidence and severity of caffeine withdrawal. 
Development and Course
Symptoms usually begin 12–24 hours after the last caffeine dose and peak after 1–2 days
of abstinence. Caffeine withdrawal symptoms last for 2–9 days, with the possibility of
withdrawal headaches occurring for up to  21 days. Symptoms usually remit rapidly
(within 30–60 minutes) after re-ingestion of caffeine. 
Caffeine is unique in that it is a behavioral ly active drug that is consumed by individ-
uals of nearly all ages. Rates of caffeine consumption and overall level of caffeine con-
sumption increase with age until the early to mid-30s and then level off. Although caffeine
withdrawal among children and adolescents has been documented, relatively little is
known about risk factors for caffeine withdrawal among this age group. The use of highly
caffeinated energy drinks is increasing with  in young individuals, which could increase
the risk for caffeine withdrawal. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Heavy caffeine use has been observ ed among individuals with mental
disorders, including eating disorders; smoker s; prisoners; and drug and alcohol abusers",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,552
"Thus, these individuals could be at higher risk for caffeine withdrawal upon acute caffeine
abstinence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,552
"Environmental. The unavailability of caffeine is an environmental risk factor for incipi-
ent withdrawal symptoms. While caffeine is le gal and usually widely available, there are
conditions in which caffeine use may be restricted, such as during medical procedures,
pregnancy, hospitalizations, religious observances, wartime, travel, and research partici-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,552

pation. These external enviro nmental circumstances may precipitate a withdrawal syn-
drome in vulnerable individuals. 
Genetic and physiological factors. Genetic factors appear to increase vulnerability to
caffeine withdrawal, but no specific genes have been identified. 
Course modifiers. Caffeine withdrawal symptoms usua lly remit within 30–60 minutes
of reexposure to caffeine. Doses of caffeine  significantly less than one’s usual daily dose
may be sufficient to prevent or attenuate caffeine withdrawal sy mptoms (e.g., consump-
tion of 25 mg by an individual who typically consumes 300 mg)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,553
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Habitual caffeine consumers who fast for religio us reasons may be at increased r isk for caf-
feine withdrawal. 
Functional Consequences of 
Caffeine Withdrawal Disorder
Caffeine withdrawal symptoms can vary from mild to extreme, at times causing functional
impairment in normal daily activities. Rates of functional impairment range from 10% to
55% (median 13%), with rates as high as 73% found among individuals who also show
other problematic features of caffeine use. Ex amples of functional impairment include be-
ing unable to work, exercise, or care for child ren; staying in bed all day; missing religious
services; ending a vacation early; and cancelling a social gathering. Caffeine withdrawal
headaches may be described by individuals as  “the worst headaches” ever experienced",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,553
"Decrements in cognitive and motor pe rformance have also been observed. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other medical disorders an d medical side effects. Several disorders should be consid-
ered in the differential diagnosis of caffeine withdrawal. Caffeine withdrawal can mimic
migraine and other headache di sorders, viral illnesses, sinu s conditions, tension, other
drug withdrawal states (e.g., from amphetami nes, cocaine), and medication side effects",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,553
"The final determination of caffeine withdrawal should rest on a determination of the pat-
tern and amount consumed, the time interval  between caffeine ab stinence and onset of
symptoms, and the particular clinical features presented by  the individual. A challenge
dose of caffeine followed by symptom remis sion may be used to confirm the diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,553

frequency (e.g., days of use per month or ti mes used per day) and/or dose (e.g., amount
used per episode) of cannabis, as assessed by in dividual self-report, report of knowledge-
able others, clinician’s observ ations, and biological testing",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,555
"Diagnostic Features
Cannabis use disorder and the other cannabis-re lated disorders include problems that are
associated with substances derived from the cannabis plant and chemically similar syn-
thetic compounds. Over time, this plant material has accumulated many names (e.g.,
weed, pot, herb, grass, reefer, mary jane, da gga, dope, bhang, skunk, boom, gangster, kif,
and ganja). A concentrated extraction of the cannabis plant that is also commonly used is
hashish. Cannabis  is the generic and perhaps the most appropriate scientific term for the
psychoactive substance(s) derived from the pl ant, and as such it is used in this manual
to refer to all forms of cannabis-like substances, including synthetic cannabinoid com-
pounds.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,555
"Cannabis Use Disorder 511
Synthetic oral formulations (pill/capsules) of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-
THC) are available by prescripti on for a number of approved medical indications (e.g., for
nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy; for anorexia and weight loss in individuals
with AIDS). Other synthetic cannabinoid co mpounds have been manufactured and dis-
tributed for nonmedical use in the form of plant material that has been sprayed with a can-
nabinoid formulation (e.g., K2, Spice, JWH-018, JWH-073). 
The cannabinoids have diverse effects in the brain, prominent among which are actions
on CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors that ar e found throughout the central nervous sys-
tem. Endogenous ligands for these receptor s behave essentially like neurotransmitters",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,556
"The potency of cannabis (delta-9-THC concentration) that is generally available varies
greatly, ranging from 1% to approximately 15% in typical cannabis plant material and
10%–20% in hashish. During the past two de cades, a steady increase in the potency of
seized cannabis has been observed. 
Cannabis is most commonly smoked via a variety of methods: pipes, water pipes
(bongs or hookahs), cigarettes (joints or reefer s), or, most recently, in the paper from hol-
lowed out cigars (blunts). Cannabis is also sometimes ingested orally, typically by mixing
it into food. More recently, devices have be en developed in which cannabis is “vapor-
ized.” Vaporization involves heating the plant material to release psychoactive cannabi-
noids for inhalation. As with other psychoactive substances, smoking (and vaporization)
typically produces more rapid onset and more intense experiences of the desired effects. 
Individuals who regularly use cannabis can develop all the genera l diagnostic features
of a substance use disorder. Cannabis use diso rder is commonly observed as the only sub-
stance use disorder experienced by the individu al; however, it also frequently occurs con-
currently with other types of substance use di sorders (i.e., alcohol, cocaine, opioid). In
cases for which multiple types of substances are used, many times the individual may
minimize the symptoms related to cannabis, as  the symptoms may be less severe or cause
less harm than those directly related to the use of the other substances. Pharmacological
and behavioral tolerance to most of the effect s of cannabis has been reported in individuals
who use cannabis persistently. Generally, tolerance is lost when cannabis use is discontin-
ued for a significant period of time (i.e., for at least several months). 
New to DSM-5 is the recognition that abrupt cessation of daily or near-daily cannabis
use often results in the onset of a cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Common symptoms of
withdrawal include irritability, anger or ag gression, anxiety, depressed mood, restless-
ness, sleep difficulty, and decreased appetite or weight loss. Although typically not as
severe as alcohol or opiate withdrawal, the cannabis withdrawal syndrome can cause sig-
nificant distress and contribute to difficulty quitting or relapse among those trying to
abstain. 
Individuals with cannabis use disorder may use cannabis throughout the day over a
period of months or years, and thus may spend many hours a da y under the influence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,556
"Others may use less frequently, but their use causes recurrent problems related to family,
school, work, or other important activities (e.g ., repeated absences at work; neglect of fam-
ily obligations). Periodic cannabis use and intoxication can negatively affect behavioral
and cognitive functioning and thus interfere with optimal performance at work or school,
or place the individual at increased physical risk when performing activities that could be
physically hazardous (e.g., driving a car; playing certain sports; performing manual work
activities, including operating machinery). Ar guments with spouses or parents over the
use of cannabis in the home, or its use in th e presence of children, can adversely impact
family functioning and are common features of  those with cannabis use disorder. Last, in-
dividuals with cannabis use disorder may continue using despite knowledge of physical
problems (e.g., chronic cough related to smoking) or psychological problems (e.g., exces-
sive sedation or exacerbation of other ment al health problems) associated with its use",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,556

diagnosis. When a substance is taken as indicated for a medical condition, symptoms of",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,556
"512 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
tolerance and withdrawal will naturally occur and should not be used as the primary cri-
teria for determining a diagnosis of a substance use disorder. Although medical uses of
cannabis remain controversial and equivocal,  use for medical circumstances should be
considered when a diagnosis is being made. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals who regularly use cannabis often report that it is being used to cope with
mood, sleep, pain, or other physiological or psychological problems, and those diagnosed
with cannabis use disorder frequently do have  concurrent other mental disorders. Careful
assessment typically reveals reports of cannabis use contributing to exacerbation of these
same symptoms, as well as other reasons for freq uent use (e.g., to experience euphoria, to
forget about problems, in respon se to anger, as an enjoyable social activity). Related to this
issue, some individuals who use cannabis mult iple times per day for the aforementioned
reasons do not perceive themselves as (and thus do not report) spending an excessive
amount of time under the influence or recovering from the effects of cannabis, despite be-
ing intoxicated on cannabis or coming down from  it effects for the majority of most days",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,557
"An important marker of a substance use disorder  diagnosis, particularly in milder cases, is
continued use despite a clear risk of negative co nsequences to other valued activities or re-
lationships (e.g., school, work, sport activity, partner or parent relationship). 
Because some cannabis users are motivated to  minimize their amount or frequency of
use, it is important to be aware of common signs and symptoms of cannabis use and intox-
ication so as to better assess the extent of us e. As with other substances, experienced users
of cannabis develop behavioral and pharmacolo gical tolerance such that it can be difficult
to detect when they are under the influence. Signs of acute and chro nic use include red eyes
(conjunctival injection), cannabis odor on clot hing, yellowing of finger tips (from smoking
joints), chronic cough, burning of incense (to hide the odor), and exaggerated craving and
impulse for specific foods, sometimes at unusual times of the day or night. 
Prevalence 
Cannabinoids, especially cann abis, are the most widely us ed illicit psychoactive sub-
stances in the United States. The 12-month prevalence of ca nnabis use disorder (DSM-IV
abuse and dependence rates combined) is appr oximately 3.4% among 12- to 17-year-olds
and 1.5% among adults age 18 years and older.  Rates of cannabis use disorder are greater
among adult males (2.2%) than among adult females (0.8%) and among 12- to 17-year-old
males (3.8%) than among 12- to 17-year-old  females (3.0%). Twelve-month prevalence
rates of cannabis use disorder among adults decrease with age, with rates highest among
18- to 29-year-olds (4.4%) and lowest amon g individuals age 65 years and older (0.01%)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,557
"The high prevalence of cannabis use disord er likely reflects the much more widespread
use of cannabis relative to other illicit drug s rather than greater addictive potential. 
Ethnic and racial differences in prevalence are moderate. Twelve-month prevalences
of cannabis use disorder vary markedly across racial-ethnic subgroups in the United
States. For 12- to 17-year-olds, rates are hi ghest among Native American and Alaska Na-
tives (7.1%) compared with Hispanics (4.1%) , whites (3.4%), African Americans (2.7%),
and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.9%). Among adults, the prevalence of can-
nabis use disorder is also highest among Nati ve Americans and Alaska Natives (3.4%) rel-
ative to rates among African Americans (1.8%) , whites (1.4%), Hispanics (1.2%), and Asian
and Pacific Islanders (1.2%). During the past decade the prevalence of cannabis use disor-
der has increased among adults and adolescent s. Gender differences in cannabis use dis-
order generally are concordant with those in  other substance use disorders. Cannabis use
disorder is more commonly observed in males,  although the magnitude of this difference
is less among adolescents. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,557
"Cannabis Use Disorder 513
Development and Course
The onset of cannabis use disorder can occur at  any time during or following adolescence,
but onset is most commonly during adolescenc e or young adulthood. Although much less
frequent, onset of cannabis use disorder in the preteen years or in the late 20s or older can
occur. Recent acceptance by some of the us e and availability of “medical marijuana” may
increase the rate of onset of cannabis use disorder among older adults",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,558
"Generally, cannabis use disorder develops over an extended period of time, although
the progression appears to be more rapid in ad olescents, particularly those with pervasive
conduct problems. Most people who develop a cannabis use disorder typically establish a
pattern of cannabis use that gradually increases in both frequency and amount. Cannabis,
along with tobacco and alcohol, is traditiona lly the first substance that adolescents try",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,558
"Many perceive cannabis use as less harmful than alcohol or tobacco use, and this percep-
tion likely contributes to increased use. Moreover, cannabis intoxication does not typically
result in as severe behavioral and cognitive dysfunction as does sig nificant alcohol intox-
ication, which may increase the probability of  more frequent use in more diverse situa-
tions than with alcohol. These factors likely contribute to the potential rapid transition
from cannabis use to a cannabis use disord er among some adolescents and the common
pattern of using throughout the day that is commonly ob served among those with more
severe cannabis use disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,558
"Cannabis use disorder among preteens, adoles cents, and young adults is typically ex-
pressed as excessive use with peers that is a component of a pattern of other delinquent
behaviors usually associated with conduct pr oblems. Milder cases primarily reflect con-
tinued use despite clear problems related to di sapproval of use by other peers, school ad-
ministration, or family, which also places the youth at risk for physical or behavioral
consequences. In more severe cases, there is a progression to using alone or using through-
out the day such that use interferes with da ily functioning and takes the place of previ-
ously established, prosocial activities",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,558
"With adolescent users, changes in mood stab ility, energy level, and eating patterns are
commonly observed. These signs and symptoms ar e likely due to the direct effects of can-
nabis use (intoxication) and the subsequent effects following acute intoxication (coming
down), as well as attempts to conceal use from others. Sc hool-related problems are com-
monly associated with cannabis use disorder in  adolescents, particularly a dramatic drop
in grades, truancy, and reduced interest in general school activities and outcomes",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,558
"Cannabis use disorder among adults typically involves well-establish ed patterns of daily
cannabis use that continue despite clear psycho social or medical problems. Many adults have
experienced repeated desire to st op or have failed at repeated cessation attempts. Milder adult
cases may resemble the more common adolescent cases in that cannabis use is not as frequent
or heavy but continues despite po tential significant consequences of sustained use. The rate of
use among middle-age and older adults appears to be increasing, likely because of a cohort ef-
fect resulting from high prevalence of use in the late 1960s and the 1970s",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,558
"Early onset of cannabis use (e.g., prior to ag e 15 years) is a robust predictor of the de-
velopment of cannabis use disorder and other types of substance use disorders and mental
disorders during young adulthood. Such early onset is likely related to concurrent other
externalizing problems, most notably conduc t disorder symptoms. However, early onset
is also a predictor of internalizing problems and as such probably reflects a general risk
factor for the development of  mental health disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,558

"Environmental. Risk factors include academic failure , tobacco smoking, unstable or abu-
sive family situation, use of cannabis among immediate family members, a family history
of a substance use disorder, and low socioecono mic status. As with all substances of abuse,
the ease of availability of the substance is a ri sk factor; cannabis is relatively easy to obtain
in most cultures, which increases the risk  of developing a cannabis use disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,559
"Genetic and physiological. Genetic influences contribute to the development of canna-
bis use disorders. Heritable factors contribute between 30% and 80% of the total variance
in risk of cannabis use disorders. It should be noted that common genetic and shared en-
vironmental influences between cannabis and other types of substance use disorders sug-
gest a common genetic basis for adolesce nt substance use and conduct problems. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Cannabis is probably the world’s most commo nly used illicit substance. Occurrence of
cannabis use disorder across countries is unkn own, but the prevalence rates are likely sim-
ilar among developed countries. It is frequently among the fi rst drugs of experimentation
(often in the teens) of all cultur al groups in the United States. 
Acceptance of cannabis for medical purposes varies widely across and within cultures",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,559
"Cultural factors (acceptability and legal status ) that might impact diagnosis relate to dif-
ferential consequences across cultures for dete ction of use (i.e., arrest, school suspensions,
or employment suspension). The general change in substance use disorder diagnostic cri-
teria from DSM-IV to DSM-5 (i.e., removal of  the recurrent substance-related legal prob-
lems criterion) mitigates this concern to some degree",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,559
"Diagnostic Markers
Biological tests for cannabinoid metabolites are useful for determining if an individual has
recently used cannabis. Such testing is help ful in making a diagnosis, particularly in
milder cases if an individual denies using while others (family, work, school) purport con-
cern about a substance use problem. Because cannabinoids are fat soluble, they persist in
bodily fluids for extended periods of time an d are excreted slowly. Expertise in urine test-
ing methods is needed to reliably interpret results. 
Functional Consequences of Cannabis Use Disorder
Functional consequences of cannabis use disord er are part of the di agnostic criteria. Many
areas of psychosocial, cognitive, and health  functioning may be co mpromised in relation
to cannabis use disorder. Cognitive function, particularly higher executive function, ap-
pears to be compromised in cannabis users, an d this relationship appears to be dose de-
pendent (both acutely and chronically). This  may contribute to increased difficulty at
school or work. Cannabis use has been related to a reduction in prosocial goal-directed ac-
tivity, which some have labeled an amotivational syndrome,  that manifests itself in poor
school performance and employ ment problems. These problems may be related to perva-
sive intoxication or recovery from the effects of intoxication . Similarly, cannabis-associated
problems with social relationships are common ly reported in those with cannabis use dis-
order. Accidents due to engagement in pote ntially dangerous behaviors while under the
influence (e.g., driving, sport, recreational or employment ac tivities) are also of concern",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,559

major psychotic illness",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,560
"Differential Diagnosis
Nonproblematic use of cannabis. The distinction between nonproblematic use of can-
nabis and cannabis use disorder can be difficult  to make because social, behavioral, or psy-
chological problems may be difficult to attribut e to the substance, especially in the context
of use of other substances. Also, denial of heavy cannabis use and the attribution that can-
nabis is related to or causing substantial problems are common among individuals who
are referred to treatment by others (i.e., sch ool, family, employer, criminal justice system)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,560
"Other mental disorders. Cannabis-induced disorder may be characterized by symp-
toms (e.g., anxiety) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., gene ralized anxiety dis-
order vs. cannabis-induced anxiety disorder, with generalized anxiety, with onset during
intoxication). Chronic intake of cannabis can produce a lack of motivation that resembles
persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Acute adverse reactions to cannabis should be
differentiated from the symptoms of panic di sorder, major depressive disorder, delusional
disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia , paranoid type. Physical examination will
usually show an increased pulse and conjunctiv al injection. Urine toxicological testing can
be helpful in making a diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,560
"Comorbidity
Cannabis has been commonly thought of as a “gateway” drug because individuals who
frequently use cannabis have a much greater lifetime probabili ty than nonusers of using
what are commonly considered more dangerou s substances, like opioids or cocaine. Can-
nabis use and cannabis use disorder are highly comorbid with other substance use disor-
ders. Co-occurring mental co nditions are common in canna bis use disorder. Cannabis use
has been associated with poor er life satisfaction; increased mental health treatment and
hospitalization; and higher rates of depressi on, anxiety disorders, suicide attempts, and
conduct disorder. Individuals with past-year or lifetime cannabis use disorder have high
rates of alcohol use disorder (greater than 50%) and tobacco use disorder (53%). Rates of
other substance use disorders are also likely to be high among individuals with cannabis
use disorder. Among those seeking treatmen t for a cannabis use disorder, 74% report
problematic use of a secondary or tertiary su bstance: alcohol (40%), cocaine (12%), meth-
amphetamine (6%), and heroin or other opia tes (2%). Among those younger than 18 years,
61% reported problematic use of a secondary su bstance: alcohol (48%), cocaine (4%), meth-
amphetamine (2%), and heroin or other opiates (2%). Cannabis use disorder is also often
observed as a secondary problem among those with a primary diagnosis of other substance
use disorders, with approximately 25%–80% of those in treatment for another substance
use disorder reporting use of cannabis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,560
"Individuals with past-year or lifetime diag noses of cannabis use disorder also have
high rates of concurrent ment al disorders other than substa nce use disorders. Major de-
pressive disorder (11%), any anxiety disorder (24%), and bipolar I disorder (13%) are quite
common among individuals with a past-year di agnosis of a cannabis use disorder, as are

The essential feature of cannabis intoxication is the presence of clinically significant prob-
lematic behavioral or psychological changes th at develop during, or shortly after, canna-
bis use (Criterion B). Intoxication typically  begins with a “high” feeling followed by
symptoms that include euphoria with inapprop riate laughter and grandiosity, sedation,
lethargy, impairment in short- term memory, difficulty carrying out complex mental pro-
cesses, impaired judgment, distorted sensory perceptions, impaired motor performance,
and the sensation that time is passing slowly. Occasionally, anxiety (which can be severe),",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,561

dysphoria, or social withdrawal occurs. These psychoactive effects are accompanied by
two or more of the following signs, developi ng within 2 hours of cannabis use: conjuncti-
val injection, increased appetite, dry mouth, and tachycardia (Criterion C). 
Intoxication develops within minutes if the cannabis is smoked but may take a few
hours to develop if the cannabis is ingested orally. The effects usually last 3–4 hours, with
the duration being somewhat lo nger when the substance is in gested orally. The magnitude
of the behavioral and physiological changes depends on the dose, the method of adminis-
tration, and the characteristics of the individual using the substance, such as rate of absorp-
tion, tolerance, and sensitivity to the effects of the substance. Because most cannabinoids,
including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-T HC), are fat soluble, the effects of canna-
bis or hashish may occasionally persist or re occur for 12–24 hours because of the slow re-
lease of psychoactive substances from fa tty tissue or to ente rohepatic circulation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,562
"Prevalence
The prevalence of actual episodes of cannabis intoxication in the general population is un-
known. However, it is probable that most ca nnabis users would at some time meet criteria
for cannabis intoxication. Given this, the prev alence of cannabis users and the prevalence
of individuals experiencing canna bis intoxication are likely similar",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,562
"Functional Consequences of Cannabis Intoxication
Impairment from cannabis intoxication ma y have serious consequences, including dys-
function at work or school, social indiscretion s, failure to fulfill role  obligations, traffic ac-
cidents, and having unprotected sex. In rare cases, cannabis intoxication may precipitate a
psychosis that may vary in duration. 
Differential Diagnosis
Note that if the clinical presentation includes  hallucinations in the absence of intact reality
testing, a diagnosis of subs tance/medication-induced psyc hotic disorder should be con-
sidered",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,562
"Other substance intoxication. Cannabis intoxicati on may resemble intoxication with
other types of substances. However, in contrast to cannabis intoxication, alcohol intoxica-
tion and sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic in toxication frequently decrease appetite, in-
crease aggressive behavior, and produce nyst agmus or ataxia. Hallucinogens in low doses
may cause a clinical picture that resembles cannabis intoxication. Phencyclidine, like can-
nabis, can be smoked and also causes perceptual changes, but phencyclidine intoxication
is much more likely to cause ataxia and aggressive behavior. 
Other cannabis-induced disorders. Cannabis intoxication is distinguished from the other
cannabis-induced disorders (e.g., cannabis-in duced anxiety disorder, with onset during
intoxication) because the symptoms in these latter disorders predomin ate the clinical pre-
sentation and are severe enough to wa rrant independent clinical attention.

is F12.288. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate
or severe cannabis use disorder, reflecting the fact that cannabis withdrawal can only oc-
cur in the presence of a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder. It is not permissible to
code a comorbid mild cannabis use disorder with cannabis withdrawal",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,563
"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of cannabis withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic withdrawal
syndrome that develops after the cessation of  or substantial reduction in heavy and pro-
longed cannabis use. In addition to the sympto ms in Criterion B, the following may also be
observed postabstinence: fatigu e, yawning, difficulty concentrating, and rebound periods
of increased appetite and hypersomnia that follo w initial periods of loss of appetite and in-
somnia. For the diagnosis, withdrawal symptoms  must cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occu pational, or other important ar eas of functioning (Criterion
C). Many cannabis users report smoking cannabi s or taking other substances to help re-
lieve withdrawal symptoms, and many report  that withdrawal symptoms make quitting
difficult or have contributed to relapse. Th e symptoms typically ar e not of sufficient se-
verity to require medical attention, but medica tion or behavioral strategies may help alle-
viate symptoms and improve prognosis in those trying to quit using cannabis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,563
"Cannabis withdrawal is commonly observed in individuals seeking treatment for can-
nabis use as well as in heavy cannabis users who are not seeking treatment. Among indi-
viduals who have used cannabis regularly during  some period of their lifetime, up to one-
third report having experienced cannabis wi thdrawal. Among adults and adolescents en-
rolled in treatment or  heavy cannabis users, 50%–95% report cannabis withdrawal. These
findings indicate that cannabis withdrawal occurs am ong a substantial subset of regular
cannabis users who try to quit. 
Development and Course
The amount, duration, and frequency of canna bis smoking that is required to produce an
associated withdrawal disorder during a quit attempt are unknown. Most symptoms have
their onset within the first 24–72 hours of ce ssation, peak within the first week, and last
approximately 1–2 weeks. Sleep difficulties may last more than 30 days. Cannabis with-
drawal has been documented among adolescents and adults. Withdrawal tends to be more
common and severe among adults, most likely related to the more persistent and greater
frequency and quantity of use among adults.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,563
"Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder 519
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Environmental. Most likely, the prevalence and severity of cannabis withdrawal are
greater among heavier cannabis users, and part icularly among those seeking treatment for
cannabis use disorders. Withdrawal severity also appears to be positiv ely related to the se-
verity of comorbid sympto ms of mental disorders. 
Functional Consequences of Cannabis Withdrawal
Cannabis users report using cannabis to re lieve withdrawal symp toms, suggesting that
withdrawal might contribute to ongoing expr ession of cannabis use disorder. Worse out-
comes may be associated with greater withdraw al. A substantial proportion of adults and
adolescents in treatment for moderate to se vere cannabis use disorder acknowledge mod-
erate to severe withdrawal symptoms, and ma ny complain that these symptoms make ces-
sation more difficult. Cannabis users report having relapsed to cannabis use or initiating
use of other drugs (e.g., tranquilizers) to pr ovide relief from cannabis withdrawal symp-
toms. Last, individuals living with cannabis us ers observe significant withdrawal effects,
suggesting that such symptoms ar e disruptive to daily living. 
Differential Diagnosis
Because many of the symptoms of cannabis wi thdrawal are also symptoms of other sub-
stance withdrawal syndromes or of depressi ve or bipolar disorder s, careful evaluation
should focus on ensuring that the symptoms ar e not better explained by cessation from an-
other substance (e.g., tobacco or alcohol with drawal), another mental  disorder (general-
ized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder), or another medical condition",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,564
"Other Cannabis-Induced Disorders
The following cannabis-induced disorders are desc ribed in other chapters of the manual with
disorders with which they share phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced
mental disorders in these chapters): cannab is-induced psychotic disorder (“Schizophrenia
Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”); cannabis-induced anxiet y disorder (“Anxiety
Disorders”); and cannabis-induced sleep diso rder (“Sleep-Wake Disorders”). For cannabis
intoxication delirium, see the criteria and disc ussion of delirium in  the chapter “Neurocog-

environment or in sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supe rvised and substanc e-free jails, therapeutic communities,
and locked hospital units. 
Diagnostic Features
The phencyclidines (or phencyclidine-like substances) include phencyclidine (e.g., PCP,
“angel dust”) and less potent but similarly ac ting compounds such as ketamine, cyclohex-
amine, and dizocilpine. These substances were  first developed as dissociative anesthetics
in the 1950s and became street drugs in the 1960s. They produce feelings of separation
from mind and body (hence “d issociative”) in low doses, an d at high doses, stupor and
coma can result. These substances are most commonly smoked or taken orally, but they
may also be snorted or injected. Although the primary psychoactive ef fects of PCP last for
a few hours, the total elimination rate of this  drug from the body typically extends 8 days
or longer. The hallucinogenic effects in vulne rable individuals may last for weeks and may
precipitate a persistent psychotic episode resembling schizophrenia. Ketamine has been
observed to have utility in the treatment of  major depressive disorder. Withdrawal symp-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,566
"522 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
toms have not been clearly established in hu mans, and therefore the withdrawal criterion
is not included in the diagnosis of phencyclidine use disorder. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Phencyclidine may be detected in urine for up to 8 days or even longer at very high doses. In
addition to laboratory tests to detect its presence, characteristic symptoms resulting from
intoxication with phencyclidine or related su bstances may aid in its diagnosis. Phencycli-
dine is likely to produce dissociative sympto ms, analgesia, nystagmus, and hypertension,
with risk of hypotension and shock. Violen t behavior can also occur with phencyclidine
use, as intoxicated persons may believe that  they are being attacked. Residual symptoms
following use may resemble schizophrenia. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of phen cyclidine use disorder is unknown.  Approximately 2.5% of the pop-
ulation reports having ever used phencyclidine. The proportion of users increases with
age, from 0.3% of 12- to 17-year-olds, to 1.3% of 18- to 25-year -olds, to 2.9% of those age 26
years and older reporting ever using phencyclid ine. There appears to have been an in-
crease among 12th graders in both ever used (to 2.3% from 1.8%) and past-year use (to 1.3%
from 1.0%) of phencyclidine. Past-year use of  ketamine appears relatively stable among
12th graders (1.6%–1.7% over the past 3 years)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,567
"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
There is little information about risk factor s for phencyclidine use disorder. Among indi-
viduals admitted to substanc e abuse treatment, those for whom phencyclidine was the
primary substance were younger than those admitted for other substance use, had lower
educational levels, and were more likely to be  located in the West and Northeast regions of
the United States, compared with other admissions.

whites (0.5%) than among other ethnic gr oups (range 0%–0.3%). Among individuals ad-

stance were predominantly black (49%) or Hispanic (29%)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,567
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Males make up about three-quarters of those with phencyclidine-related emergency room
visits",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,567
"Diagnostic Markers
Laboratory testing may be useful, as phencyclidin e is present in the urine in intoxicated in-
dividuals up to 8 days after ingestion. The in dividual’s history, along with certain physical
signs, such as nystagmus, analgesia and pr ominent hypertension, may aid in distinguish-
ing the phencyclidine clinical picture from that of other hallucinogens. 
Functional Consequences of Phencyclidine Use Disorder
In individuals with phencyclidine use disorder, there may be physical evidence of injuries
from accidents, fights, and falls. Chronic use of phencyclidine may lead to deficits in mem-
ory, speech, and cognition that may last for months. Cardiovascular and neurological tox-
icities (e.g., seizures, dystonias, dyskinesia s, catalepsy, hypothermia or hyperthermia)
may result from intoxication with phencyclid ine. Other consequences include intracranial

Diagnostic Features 
Hallucinogens comprise a diverse group of subs tances that, despite ha ving different chem-
ical structures and possibly involving diffe rent molecular mechan isms, produce similar
alterations of percepti on, mood, and cognition in users. Hallucinogens included are phenyl-
alkylamines (e.g., mescaline, DOM [2,5-d imethoxy-4-methylam phetamine], and MDMA
[3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; also called “ecstasy ”]); the indoleamines, includ-
ing psilocybin (i.e., psilocin) and dimethyltryptamine (DMT); an d the ergolines, such as LSD
(lysergic acid diethylamide) and morning glory seeds. In addition, miscellaneous other
ethnobotanical compounds are classifi ed as “hallucinogens,” of which Salvia divinorum  and
jimsonweed are two examples. Excluded from the hallucinogen group are cannabis and its
active compound, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabino l (THC) (see the section “Cannabis-Related
Disorders”). These substances can have hallucinogenic effects but are diagnosed separately
because of significant differences in their psychological and behavioral effects",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,569
"Hallucinogens are usually taken orally, al though some forms are smoked (e.g., DMT,
salvia) or (rarely) taken intranasally or by in jection (e.g., ecstasy). Duration of effects varies",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,569
"Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder 525
across types of hallucinogens. Some of th ese substances (i.e., LS D, MDMA) have a long
half-life and extended duration such that us ers may spend hours to days using and/or re-
covering from the effects of these drugs. Ho wever, other hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., DMT,
salvia) are short acting. Tolerance to hallucinogens develops with repeated use and has
been reported to have both autonomic and psyc hological effects. Cros s-tolerance exists be-
tween LSD and other hallucinogens (e.g., psil ocybin, mescaline) but does not extend to
other drug categories such as amphetamines and cannabis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,570
"MDMA/ecstasy as a hallucinogen may have distin ctive effects attributable to both its hal-
lucinogenic and its stimulant properties. Amon g heavy ecstasy users, continued use despite
physical or psychological problems, tolerance,  hazardous use, and sp ending a great deal of
time obtaining the substance are the most commonly reported criteria—over 50% in adults
and over 30% in a younger sample , while legal problems related to substance use and persis-
tent desire/inability to quit are rarely reported. As found for other substances, diagnostic cri-
teria for other hallucinogen use disorder are arrayed along a single continuum of severity. 
One of the generic criteria for substance us e disorders, a clinically significant with-
drawal syndrome, has not been consistently documented in humans, and therefore the di-
agnosis of hallucinogen withdrawal syndrome is not included in DSM-5. However, there
is evidence of withdrawal from MDMA, wi th endorsement of two or more withdrawal
symptoms observed in 59%–98% in selected samples of ecstasy users. Both psychological
and physical problems have been common ly reported as withdrawal problems. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
The characteristic symptom feat ures of some of the hallucinogens can aid in diagnosis if
urine or blood toxicology result s are not available. For exam ple, individuals who use LSD
tend to experience visual hallucinations that  can be frightening. Individuals intoxicated
with hallucinogens may exhibit a temporary increase in suicidality. 
Prevalence
Of all substance use disorders, other hallucinogen use disorder is one of the rarest. The
12-month prevalence is estimated to be 0.5% among 12- to 17-year-olds and 0.1% among
adults age 18 and older in the United States. Rates are higher in adult males (0.2%) compared
with females (0.1%), but the oppo site is observed in adolescent samples ages 12–17, in which
the 12-month rate is slightly higher in females (0 .6%) than in males (0.4%). Rates are highest in
individuals younger than 30 years, with the peak occurring in individuals ages 18–29 years
(0.6%) and decreasing to virtually 0.0% among individuals age 45 and older. 
There are marked ethnic differences in 12-mo nth prevalence of ot her hallucinogen use
disorder. Among youths ages 12–17 years, 12-month prevalence is higher among Native
Americans and Alaska Natives (1.2%) than am ong Hispanics (0.6%), whites (0.6%), Afri-
can Americans (0.2%), and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.2%). Among adults,
12-month prevalence of other hallucinogen use disorder is similar for Native Americans
and Alaska Natives, whites, and Hispanics (a ll 0.2%) but somewhat lower for Asian Amer-
icans and Pacific Islanders (0.07%) and Africa n Americans (0.03%). Past-year prevalence is
higher in clinical samples (e.g., 19% in ad olescents in treatment) . Among individuals cur-
rently using hallucinogens in the general popu lation, 7.8% (adult) to 17% (adolescent) had
a problematic pattern of use that met criteria  for past-year other hallucinogen use disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,570

use), 73.5% of adults and 77% of adolescents have a problematic pattern of use that may

"Development and Course
Unlike most substances where an early age at on set is associated with elevations in risk for
the corresponding use disorder, it is unclear wh ether there is an association of an early age",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,570

at onset with elevations in risk for other hallucinogen use disorder. However, patterns of
drug consumption have been found to differ by age at onset, with early-onset ecstasy users
more likely to be polydrug users than their later-onset counterpar ts. There may be a dis-
proportionate influence of use of specific hallu cinogens on risk of developing other hallu-
cinogen use disorder, with use of ecstasy/MDMA increasing the risk of the disorder
relative to use of other hallucinogens",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,571
"Little is known regarding the co urse of other hallucinogen use disorder, but it is generally
thought to have low incidence, low persistence, and high rates of recovery. Adolescents are es-
pecially at risk for using these drugs, and it is  estimated that 2.7% of youths ages 12–17 years
have used one or more of these drugs in the past 12 months, with 44 % having used ecstasy/
MDMA. Other hallucinogen use disorder is a disorder observed primarily in individuals
younger than 30 years, with rates vanishingly rare among older adults",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,571
"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. In adolescents but not consistently in adults, MDMA use is associated with
an elevated rate of other hallucinogen use di sorder. Other substance use disorders, particu-
larly alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis, and major depressive disorder are associated with ele-
vated rates of other hallucino gen use disorder. Antisocial personality disorder may be
elevated among individuals who use more than two other drugs in addition to hallucinogens,
compared with their counterparts with less exte nsive use history. The influence of adult anti-
social behaviors—but not conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder—on other hal-
lucinogen use disorder may be stronger in female s than in males. Use of specific hallucinogens
(e.g., salvia) is prominent am ong individuals ages 18–25 years with other risk-taking behaviors
and illegal activities. Cannabis use has also been implicated as a precursor to initiation of use of
hallucinogens (e.g., ecstasy), along with early use of alcohol and tobacco. Higher drug use by
peers and high sensation seeking have also been associated with elevated rates of ecstasy use",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,571
MDMA/ecstasy use appears to signify a more severe group of hallucinogen users,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,571
"Genetic and physiological. Among male twins, total varian ce due to additive genetics
has been estimated to range from 26% to 79%, with inconsistent evidence for shared envi-
ronmental influences. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
Historically, hallucinogens have been used as part of established re ligious practices, such
as the use of peyote in the Native American Church and in Mexico. Ritual use by indige-
nous populations of psilocybin obtained from  certain types of mushrooms has occurred in
South America, Mexico, and some areas in the United States, or of ayahuasca in the Santo
Daime and União de Vegetal sects. Regular use of  peyote as part of religious rituals is not
linked to neuropsychological or psychological de ficits. For adults, no race or ethnicity dif-
ferences for the full criteria or for any indi vidual criterion are apparent at this time. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues 
In adolescents, females may be less likely th an males to endorse “hazardous use,” and fe-
male gender may be associated with increase d odds of other hallucinogen use disorder. 
Diagnostic Markers 
Laboratory testing can be useful in distin guishing among the different hallucinogens",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,571
"However, because some agents (e.g., LSD) are so potent that as little as 75 micrograms can
produce severe reactions, typical toxicologi cal examination will not always reveal which
substance has been used. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,571
"Phencyclidine Intoxication 527
Functional Consequences of 
Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder
There is evidence for long-term neurotoxic effects of MDMA/ecstasy use, including im-
pairments in memory, psychological function , and neuroendocrine function; serotonin
system dysfunction; and sleep disturbance; as  well as adverse effects on brain microvas-
culature, white matter maturation, and damage to axons. Use of MDMA/ecstasy may di-
minish functional connectiv ity among brain regions. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other substance use disorders. The effects of hallucinogens must be distinguished from
those of other substances (e.g., amphetamines ), especially because contamination of the
hallucinogens with other dr ugs is relatively common. 
Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia also must be ruled out,  as some affected individuals (e.g.,
individuals with schizophrenia who exhibit paranoia) may falsely attribute their symp-
toms to use of hallucinogens. 
Other mental disorders or medical conditions. Other potential disorders or conditions
to consider include panic disorder, depressive  and bipolar disorders, alcohol or sedative
withdrawal, hypoglycemia and other metabolic  conditions, seizure disorder, stroke, oph-
thalmological disorder, and central nervous sy stem tumors. Careful history of drug tak-
ing, collateral reports from family and friends (if possible), age, clin ical history, physical
examination, and toxicology reports should be useful in arriving at the final diagnostic de-
cision. 
Comorbidity
Adolescents who use MDMA/ecstasy and other ha llucinogens, as well as adults who have
recently used ecstasy, have a higher preval ence of other substance use disorders compared
with nonhallucinogen substance users. Individuals who use halluc inogens exhibit eleva-
tions of nonsubstance mental disorders (espec ially anxiety, depressi ve, and bipolar disor-
ders), particularly with use of ecstasy and salvia. Rates of antisocial personality disorder (but
not conduct disorder) are significantly elevated among individuals with other hallucinogen
use disorder, as are rates of adult antisocial  behavior. However, it is unclear whether the
mental illnesses may be precursors to rather than consequences of other hallucinogen use
disorder (see the section “Risk and Prognostic Factors” for this disorder). Both adults and
adolescents who use ecstasy are mo re likely than other drug us ers to be polydrug users and
to have other drug use disorders.

ual was intoxicated with the hallucinogen (C riterion A). The symptoms may include any
perceptual perturbations, but visual disturbanc es tend to be predomin ant. Typical of the ab-
normal visual perceptions are geometric hallucinations, false percep tions of movement in
the peripheral visual fields, flashes of color, in tensified colors, trails of  images of moving ob-
jects (i.e., images left suspended in the path of  a moving object as seen in stroboscopic pho-
tography), perceptions of entire objects, po sitive afterimages (i.e., a same-colored or

Development and Course
Little is known about the development of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. Its
course, as suggested by its name, is persistent, lasting for weeks, months, or even years in
certain individuals. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
There is little evidence regarding risk factor s for hallucinogen persisting perception dis-
order, although genetic factors have been suggested as a possible explanation underlying
the susceptibility to LSD effects in this condition. 
Functional Consequences of 
Hallucinogen Persisting  Perception Disorder
Although hallucinogen persisting perception  disorder remains a chronic condition in
some cases, many individuals with the disord er are able to suppres s the disturbances and
continue to function normally. 
Differential Diagnosis
Conditions to be ruled out include schizophrenia, other drug  effects, neurodegenerative
disorders, stroke, brain tumors, infections, an d head trauma. Neuroimaging results in hal-
lucinogen persisting perception disorder cases are typically negative. As noted earlier, re-
ality testing remains intact (i.e., the individual is aware that the disturbance is linked to the
effect of the drug); if this is not the case, another disorder (e.g., psychotic disorder, another
medical condition) might better ex plain the abnormal perceptions. 
Comorbidity
Common comorbid mental disorders accomp anying hallucinogen persisting perception
disorder are panic disorder , alcohol use disorder, and major depressive disorder. 
Other Phencyclidine-Induced Disorders
Other phencyclidine-induced diso rders are described in other chapters of the manual with
disorders with which they share phenomeno logy (see the substance/medication-induced
mental disorders in these chap ters): phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder (“Schizo-
phrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disord ers”); phencyclidine-induced bipolar dis-
order (“Bipolar and Related Disorders”); phencyclidine-induced depressive disorder
(“Depressive Disorders”); and phencyclidin e-induced anxiety disorder (“Anxiety Disor-
ders”). For phencyclidine-induced intoxication delirium, see the criteria and discussion of
delirium in the chapter “Neurocognitive Di sorders.” These phencyclidine-induced disor-
ders are diagnosed instead of phencyclidine in toxication only when the symptoms are suf-
ficiently severe to warrant in dependent clinical attention. 
Other Hallucinogen-Induced Disorders
The following other hallucinogen- induced disorders are describe d in other chapters of the
manual with disorder s with which they share phenome nology (see the substance/medi-

"Inhalant Use Disorder 535
Specifiers
This manual recognizes volatile hydrocarbon use meeting the above diagnostic criteria as
inhalant use disorder. Volatile hydrocarbons are toxic gases from glues, fuels, paints, and
other volatile compounds. When possible, th e particular substance involved should be
named (e.g., “toluene use disorder”). However, most compounds that are inhaled are a
mixture of several substances that can produce psychoactive effects, and it is often difficult
to ascertain the exact substance responsible fo r the disorder. Unless there is clear evidence
that a single, unmixed substance has been used , the general term inhalant should be used
in recording the diagnosis. Disorders arising from inhalation of nitrous oxide or of amyl-,
butyl-, or isobutylnitrite are considered as other (or unkn own) substance use disorder. 
“In a controlled environment” applies as a fu rther specifier of remission if the individ-
ual is both in remission and in a controlled en vironment (i.e., in early remission in a con-
trolled environment or in su stained remission in a contro lled environment). Examples of
these environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communi-
ties, and locked hospital units. 
The severity of individuals’ inhalant use di sorder is assessed by the number of diag-
nostic criteria endorsed. Changing severity of individuals’ inhalant use disorder across
time is reflected by reductions in the frequency (e.g., days used per month) and/or dose
(e.g., tubes of glue per day) used, as assessed by the individual’s self-report, report of oth-
ers, clinician’s observations, and bi ological testing (when practical)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,580
"Diagnostic Features
Features of inhalant use disorder include repe ated use of an inhalant substance despite the
individual’s knowing that the substance is causing serious problems for the individual
(Criterion A9). Those problems are re flected in the diagnostic criteria. 
Missing work or school or inability to perform typical responsibilities at work or school
(Criterion A5), and continued us e of the inhalant substance even though it causes arguments
with family or friends, fights, and other social  or interpersonal proble ms (Criterion A6), may
be seen in inhalant use disorder. Limiting family contact, work or school obligations, or rec-
reational activities (e.g., sports , games, hobbies) may also occu r (Criterion A7). Use of inhal-
ants when driving or operating dangerous equipment (Criterion A8) is also seen",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,580
"Tolerance (Criterion A10) and mild withdraw al are each reported by about 10% of in-
dividuals who use inhalants, and a few individuals use inhalants to avoid withdrawal",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,580
"However, because the withdrawal symptoms ar e mild, this manual neither recognizes a
diagnosis of inhalant withdrawal nor counts withdrawal complaints as a diagnostic crite-
rion for inhalant use disorder. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
A diagnosis of inhalant use disorder is suppo rted by recurring epis odes of intoxication
with negative results in standard drug screens (which do not detect inhalants); possession,
or lingering odors, of inhalant substances; peri-oral or peri-nasal “glue-sniffer’s rash”; as-
sociation with other individuals known to use inhalants; membership in groups with prev-
alent inhalant use (e.g., some native or abor iginal communities, ho meless children in street
gangs); easy access to certain inhalant substances; paraphernalia possession; presence of
the disorder’s characteristic medical compli cations (e.g., brain white matter pathology,
rhabdomyolysis); and the presence of multiple  substance use disorders. Inhalant use and
inhalant use disorder are asso ciated with past suicide atte mpts, especially among adults
reporting previous episodes of low mood or anhedonia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,580
"Prevalence
About 0.4% of Americans ages 12–17 years have a pattern of use that me ets criteria for in-
halant use disorder in the past 12 months. Among those youths, the prevalence is highest",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,580
"536 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
in Native Americans and lowest in African Americans. Prevalence falls to about 0.1% among
Americans ages 18–29 years, and only 0.02% when all Americans 18 years or older are con-
sidered, with almost no females and a prepon derance of European Am ericans. Of course,
in isolated subgroups, prevalence may di ffer considerably from  these overall rates. 
Development and Course
About 10% of 13-year-old American children re port having used inhalants at least once;
that percentage remains stable through age 17 years. Among those 12- to 17-year-olds who
use inhalants, the more-used substances includ e glue, shoe polish, or toluene; gasoline or
lighter fluid; or spray paints. 
Only 0.4% of 12- to 17-year-olds progress to  inhalant use disorder; those youths tend to
exhibit multiple other problems. The declining prevalence of inhalant use disorder after
adolescence indicates that this disorder  usually remits in early adulthood",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,581
"Volatile hydrocarbon use disorder is rare in prepubertal children, most common in ad-
olescents and young adults, and uncommon in older persons. Calls to poison-control cen-
ters for “intentional abuse” of inhalants peak with calls involving individuals at age 14 years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,581
"Of adolescents who use inhalants, perhaps on e-fifth develop inhalant use disorder; a few
die from inhalant-related accide nts, or “sudden sniffing death”. But the disorder apparently
remits in many individuals after adolescence.  Prevalence declines dramatically among in-
dividuals in their 20s. Those with inhalant use disorder extending into adulthood often
have severe problems: substance use disorder s, antisocial personality disorder, and sui-
cidal ideation with attempts. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Predictors of progression from nonuse of inhalant s, to use, to inhalant
use disorder include comorbid non-inhalant substance use disorders and either conduct
disorder or antisocial personality disorder. Other predictors are ea rlier onset of inhalant
use and prior use of mental health services. 
Environmental. Inhalant gases are widely and legally available, increasing the risk of mis-
use. Childhood maltreatment or  trauma also is associated with youthful progression from
inhalant non-use to inhalant use disorder. 
Genetic and physiological. Behavioral disinhibition  is a highly heritable general propensity
to not constrain behavior in socially acceptable  ways, to break social norms and rules, and to
take dangerous risks, pursuing rewards excessi vely despite dangers of  adverse consequences",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,581

onset substance use disorder, multiple substa nce involvement, and ea rly conduct problems",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,581

selves impractical",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,582
"Functional Consequences of  Inhalant Use Disorder 
Because of inherent toxicity, use of butane or  propane is not infrequently fatal. Moreover,
any inhaled volatile hydrocarbons may produc e “sudden sniffing death” from cardiac ar-
rhythmia. Fatalities may occur even on the first inhalant exposure and are not thought to
be dose-related. Volatile hydrocarbon use impairs neurobehavioral function and causes
various neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and pulmonary problems. 
Long-term inhalant users are at increased risk for tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, sexually
transmitted diseases, depression , anxiety, bronchitis, asthma , and sinusitis. Deaths may
occur from respiratory depression, arrhythmia s, asphyxiation, aspiration of vomitus, or
accident and injury",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,582

Inhalant intoxication is an inhalant-related, cl inically significant mental disorder that de-
velops during, or immediately after, intended or unintended inhalation of a volatile hy-
drocarbon substance. Volatile hydrocarbons are toxic gases fr om glues, fuels, paints, and
other volatile compounds. When it is possible to do so, the particular substance involved
should be named (e.g., toluene intoxication).  Among those who do, the intoxication clears
within a few minutes to a few hours after th e exposure ends. Thus, inhalant intoxication
usually occurs in brief episodes that may recur.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,583
"Inhalant Intoxication 539
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Inhalant intoxication may be indicated by eviden ce of possession, or lingering odors, of in-
halant substances (e.g., glue, paint thinner, gasoline, butane lighters); apparent intoxica-
tion occurring in the age range with the highest prevalence of inhalant use (12–17 years);
and apparent intoxication with negative results from the standard drug screens that usu-
ally fail to identify inhalants",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,584
"Prevalence
The prevalence of actual episode s of inhalant intoxication in the general population is un-
known, but it is probable that most inhalant users would at some time exhibit use that
would meet criteria for inhalant intoxication disorder. Therefore, the prevalence of inhal-
ant use and the prevalence of inhalant intoxi cation disorder are likely similar. In 2009 and
2010, inhalant use in the past year was reported by 0.8% of all Americans older than 12 years;
the prevalence was highest in younger age groups (3.6% for individuals 12 to 17 years old,
and 1.7% for individuals 18 to 25 years old)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,584
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Gender differences in the prevalence of inhalant intoxication in the general population are
unknown. However, if it is assumed that most inhalant users eventually experience inhal-
ant intoxication, gender differences  in the prevalence of inhalant users  likely approximate
those in the proportions of males and females experiencing inhalant intoxication. Regard-
ing gender differences in the pr evalence of inhalant users in the United States, 1% of males
older than 12 years and 0.7% of females older than 12 years have used inhalants in the pre-
vious year, but in the younger age groups more  females than males have used inhalants
(e.g., among 12- to 17-year-olds, 3. 6% of males and 4.2% of females)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,584
"Functional Consequences of Inhalant Intoxication
Use of inhaled substances in a closed container, such as a plastic bag over the head, may
lead to unconsciousness, anoxia, and death.  Separately, “sudden sniffing death,” likely
from cardiac arrhythmia or arrest, may occu r with various volatile inhalants. The en-
hanced toxicity of certain vola tile inhalants, such as butane or propane, also causes fatal-
ities. Although inhalant intoxication itself is of short duration, it may produce persisting
medical and neurological problems, especi ally if the intoxications are frequent.

a controlled environment (i.e., in  early remission in a controlled environment or in sustained
remission in a controlled envi ronment). Examples of these en vironments are closely super-
vised and substance-free jail s, therapeutic communities, an d locked hospital units. 
Changing severity across time in an individual  is also reflected by reductions in the fre-
quency (e.g., days of use per month) and/or dose (e.g., injections or number of pills) of an
opioid, as assessed by the individual’s self-r eport, report of knowledgeable others, clini-
cian’s observations, and biological testing",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,587
"Diagnostic Features
Opioid use disorder includes signs and sympto ms that reflect compulsive, prolonged self-
administration of opioid substances that are used for no legitimate medical purpose or, if
another medical condition is pres ent that requires opioid treatment, that are used in doses
greatly in excess of the amount needed for th at medical condition. (F or example, an indi-
vidual prescribed analgesic opioids for pain re lief at adequate dosing will use significantly
more than prescribed and not only because of persistent pain.) Individuals with opioid use
disorder tend to develop such regular patterns of compulsive drug use that daily activities
are planned around obtaining and administer ing opioids. Opioids are usually purchased
on the illegal market but may also be obtained  from physicians by falsifying or exagger-
ating general medical problems or by receiv ing simultaneous prescr iptions from several
physicians. Health care professionals with op ioid use disorder will often obtain opioids by
writing prescriptions for themselves or by dive rting opioids that have been prescribed for
patients or from pharmacy supplies. Most individuals with opioid use disorder have
significant levels of tolerance and will experience withdrawal on abrupt discontinuation
of opioid substances. Individuals with opio id use disorder ofte n develop conditioned
responses to drug-related stimuli (e.g., cr aving on seeing any he roin powder–like sub-
stance)—a phenomenon that occu rs with most drugs that cause intense psychological
changes. These responses probably contribute to relapse, are difficult to extinguish, and typ-
ically persist long after detoxification is completed.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,587

"Prevalence
The 12-month prevalence of opioid use disord er is approximately 0. 37% among adults age
18 years and older in the community population. This may be an underestimate because of
the large number of incarcerated individuals wi th opioid use disorders. Rates are higher in
males than in females (0.49% vs. 0.26%), with the male-to-female ratio typically being 1.5:1
for opioids other than heroin (i.e., available by prescription) and 3:1 for heroin. Female ad-
olescents may have a higher likelihood of developing opioid use disorders. The preva-
lence decreases with age, with the prevalence  highest (0.82%) among adults age 29 years or
younger, and decreasing to 0.09% among adul ts age 65 years and older. Among adults, the
prevalence of opioid use di sorder is lower among African Americans at 0.18% and over-
represented among Native Americans at 1.25%. It is close to average among whites (0.38%),
Asian or Pacific Islanders (0.35%), and Hispanics (0.39%)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,588
"Among individuals in the United States ages 12–17 years, the overall 12-month prev-
alence of opioid use disorder in the community population is approximately 1.0%, but the

"Development and Course
Opioid use disorder can begin at any age, bu t problems associated with opioid use are
most commonly first observed in the late teens or early 20s. Once opioid use disorder
develops, it usually continues over a period of many years,  even though brief periods of
abstinence are frequent. In treated populati ons, relapse following abstinence is common",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,588
"Even though relapses do occur, and while so me long-term mortality rates may be as high
as 2% per year, about 20%–30% of individuals with opioid use disorder achieve long-term
abstinence. An exception concerns that of military service perso nnel who became depen-
dent on opioids in Vietnam; over 90% of this population who had been dependent on opi-
oids during deployment in Vietnam achieved  abstinence after they returned, but they
experienced increased rates of alcohol or amph etamine use disorder as  well as increased
suicidality",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,588

individuals continue have presentations that m eet opioid use disorder  criteria for decades",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,588
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. The risk for opiate use disorder can be related to individual,
family, peer, and social environmental factors,  but within these domains, genetic factors
play a particularly important role both dire ctly and indirectly. For instance, impulsivity
and novelty seeking are individu al temperaments that relate to the propensity to develop",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,588
"544 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
a substance use disorder but may themselves be genetically determined. Peer factors may
relate to genetic predisposition in terms of how an individual selects his or her environ-
ment. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Despite small variations regarding individual criterion items, opioid use disorder diag-
nostic criteria perform equally well across most race/ethnicity groups. Individuals from
ethnic minority populations living in econom ically deprived area s have been overrep-
resented among individuals with opioid use disorder. However, over time, opioid use
disorder is seen more often among white middle-class individuals, especially females,
suggesting that differences in use reflect the availability of opioid drugs and that other so-
cial factors may impact prevalence. Medical personnel who have ready access to opioids
may be at increased risk for opioid use disorder. 
Diagnostic Markers
Routine urine toxicology test re sults are often positive for opioid drugs in individuals with
opioid use disorder. Urine test results remain positive for most opioids (e.g., heroin, mor-
phine, codeine, oxycodone, propoxyphene) for 12–36 hours after administration. Fentanyl
is not detected by standard urine tests but can be identified by more specialized proce-
dures for several days. Methadone, buprenorphine (or buprenorphine/naloxone combi-
nation), and LAAM ( L-alpha-acetylmethadol) have to be specifically tested for and will not
cause a positive result on routine tests for opiates. They can be detected for several days up
to more than 1 week. Laboratory evidence of the presence of other substances (e.g., co-
caine, marijuana, alcohol, amphetamines, benzodiazepines) is common . Screening test re-
sults for hepatitis A, B, and C virus are positive in as many as 80%–90% of injection opioid
users, either for hepatitis antigen (signifying ac tive infection) or for hepatitis antibody (sig-
nifying past infection). HIV is prevalent in injection opioid users as well. Mildly elevated
liver function test results are common, either as a result of re solving hepatitis or from toxic
injury to the liver due to contaminants that have been mixed with the injected opioid. Sub-
tle changes in cortisol secretion patterns and body temperature regulation have been ob-
served for up to 6 months following opioid detoxification",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,589
"Suicide Risk
Similar to the risk generally observed for a ll substance use disorders, opioid use disorder
is associated with a heightened  risk for suicide attempts and completed suicides. Particu-
larly notable are both accidental  and deliberate opioid overdose s. Some suicide risk factors
overlap with risk factors for an opioid use di sorder. In addition, repeated opioid intoxica-
tion or withdrawal may be associated with severe depressions that, although temporary,
can be intense enough to lead to suicide attempts and completed su icides. Available data
suggest that nonfatal accidental opioid ov erdose (which is common) and attempted sui-
cide are distinct clinically significant proble ms that should not be mistaken for each other",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,589
"Functional Consequences of Opioid Use Disorder
Opioid use is associated with a lack of mu cous membrane secretions, causing dry mouth
and nose. Slowing of gastrointestinal activity  and a decrease in gut motility can produce
severe constipation. Visual acuity may be im paired as a result of pupillary constriction
with acute administration. In individuals who inject opioids, sclerosed veins (“tracks”)
and puncture marks on the lower portions of the upper extremities are common. Veins
sometimes become so severely sclerosed that peripheral edema develops, and individuals
switch to injecting in veins in the legs, neck , or groin. When these veins become unusable,
individuals often inject directly into their su bcutaneous tissue (“sk in-popping”), resulting",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,589
"Opioid Use Disorder 545
in cellulitis, abscesses, and circ ular-appearing scars from healed skin lesions. Tetanus and
Clostridium botulinum  infections are relatively rare bu t extremely serious consequences of
injecting opioids, especially with contaminated  needles. Infections may also occur in other
organs and include bacterial endocarditis, hepa titis, and HIV infection. Hepatitis C infec-
tions, for example, may occur in up to 90% of  persons who inject opioids. In addition, the
prevalence of HIV infection ca n be high among individuals who inject drugs, a large pro-
portion of whom are individuals with opioid  use disorder. HIV infection rates have been
reported to be as high as 60% among heroin users with opioid use disorder in some areas
of the United States or the Russian Federati on. However, the incidence may also be 10% or
less in other areas, especially those where a ccess to clean injection material and parapher-
nalia is facilitated",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,590

"In relation to infections such as cellulitis, hepatitis, HIV infection, tuberculosis, and en-
docarditis, opioid use d isorder is associated with a mort ality rate as high as 1.5%–2% per
year. Death most often results from overdose, accidents, injuries, AIDS, or other general
medical complications. Accidents and injuries due to violence that is associated with buy-
ing or selling drugs are common. In some areas,  violence accounts for more opioid-related
deaths than overdose or HIV infection. Phy siological dependence on opioids may occur in
about half of the infants born to females with opioid use disorder; this can produce a se-
vere withdrawal syndrome requiring medical treatment. Although low birth weight is
also seen in children of mothers with opioid  use disorder, it is usually not marked and is
generally not associated with serious adverse consequences",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,590
"Differential Diagnosis
Opioid-induced mental disorders. Opioid-induced disorders o ccur frequently in individ-
uals with opioid use disorder. Opioid-induced  disorders may be characterized by symptoms
(e.g., depressed mood) that rese mble primary mental disorders (e.g., persistent depressive dis-
order [dysthymia] vs. opioid-induced depressive disorder, with depressive features, with on-
set during intoxication). Opioids are less likel y to produce symptoms of mental disturbance
than are most other drug s of abuse. Opioid intoxication and opioid withdrawal are distin-
guished from the other opioid-induced disorder s (e.g., opioid-induced  depressive disorder,
with onset during intoxication ) because the symptoms in thes e latter disorders predominate
the clinical presentation and are severe enou gh to warrant independent clinical attention",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,590
"Other substance intoxication. Alcohol intoxication and seda tive, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
intoxication can cause a clinical picture that resembles that for opioid intoxication. A diag-
nosis of alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiol ytic intoxication can usually be made based
on the absence of pupillary constriction or the lack of a response to naloxone challenge. In
some cases, intoxication may be  due both to opioids and to alcohol or other sedatives. In
these cases, the naloxone challenge will no t reverse all of the sedative effects. 
Other withdrawal disorders. The anxiety and restlessness associated with opioid with-
drawal resemble symptoms seen in sedative-hypnotic withdrawal. However, opioid
withdrawal is also accompanied by rhinorrhea , lacrimation, and pupillary dilation, which",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,590

are not seen in sedative-type withdrawal. Dilated pupils ar e also seen in hallucinogen
intoxication and stimulant in toxication. However, other si gns or symptoms of opioid
withdrawal, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, rhinorrhea, or lacri-
mation, are not present. 
Comorbidity 
The most common medical conditions associated with opioid use disorder are viral (e.g.,
HIV, hepatitis C virus) and bact erial infections, particularly among users of opioids by in-
jection. These infections are less common in opioid use disorder with prescription opioids",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,591
"Opioid use disorder is often associated with other substance use disord ers, especially those
involving tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, and benzodiazepines, which are often
taken to reduce symptoms of op ioid withdrawal or craving for opioids, or to enhance the ef-
fects of administered opioids. Individuals with opioid use disorder are at risk for the devel-
opment of mild to moderate depression that  meets symptomatic and duration criteria for
persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) or, in some cases, for major depressive disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,591

tisocial personality disorder is much more common in individuals with opioid use disorder
than in the general population. Posttraumatic stress disorder is also seen with increased fre-
quency. A history of conduct disorder in childh ood or adolescence has been identified as a

Other substance intoxication. Alcohol intoxication and se dative-hypnotic intoxication
can cause a clinical picture that resembles op ioid intoxication. A diagnosis of alcohol or

striction or the lack of a response to a naloxo ne challenge. In some cases, intoxication may
be due both to opioids and to alcohol or other sedatives. In these cases, the naloxone chal-
lenge will not reverse all of  the sedative effects.

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of opioid withdrawal is  the presence of a characteristic withdrawal
syndrome that develops after the cessation of  (or reduction in) opioid use that has been
heavy and prolonged (Cri terion A1). The withdrawal synd rome can also be precipitated
by administration of an opioid  antagonist (e.g., naloxone or naltrexone) after a period of
opioid use (Criterion A2). This may also occur after administration of an opioid partial ag-
onist such as buprenorphine to a person  currently using a full opioid agonist",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,593
"Opioid withdrawal is characte rized by a pattern of signs and symptoms that are oppo-
site to the acute agonist effects. The first of these are subjective and consist of complaints of
anxiety, restlessness, and an “achy feeling” that is often located in the back and legs, along
with irritability and increased sensitivity to pain. Three or more of the following must be
present to make a diagnosis of opioid with drawal: dysphoric mood; nausea or vomiting;
muscle aches; lacrimation or rhinorrhea; pu pillary dilation, piloerection, or increased
sweating; diarrhea; yawning; fever; and insomn ia (Criterion B). Piloerection and fever are
associated with more severe withdrawal and are not often seen in routine clinical practice
because individuals with opioid use disorder  usually obtain substances before with-
drawal becomes that far advanced. These sy mptoms of opioid withdrawal must cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important ar-
eas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms  must not be attributable to another med-

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Males with opioid withdrawal may experien ce piloerection, sweating, and spontaneous
ejaculations while awake. Opioid withdrawal is distinct from opioid use disorder and
does not necessarily occur in the presence of the drug-seeking behavior associated with
opioid use disorder. Opioid withdrawal may o ccur in any individual after cessation of re-
peated use of an opioid, whether in the se tting of medical management of pain, during
opioid agonist therapy fo r opioid use disorder, in the contex t of private recreational use, or
following attempts to self-treat sympto ms of mental disorders with opioids",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,594
"Prevalence
Among individuals from various  clinical settings, opioid withdrawal occurred in 60% of
individuals who had used heroin at least once in the prior 12 months. 
Development and Course
Opioid withdrawal is typical in the course of an opioid use disorder. It can be part of an es-
calating pattern in which an opioid is used to  reduce withdrawal symptoms, in turn lead-
ing to more withdrawal at a later time. Fo r persons with an established opioid use
disorder, withdrawal and attempts to  relieve withdrawal are typical. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other withdrawal disorders. The anxiety and restlessness associated with opioid with-
drawal resemble symptoms seen  in sedative-hypnotic withdrawal. However, opioid with-
drawal is also accompanied by rhinorrhea, la crimation, and pupillary dilation, which are
not seen in sedative-type withdrawal. 
Other substance intoxication. Dilated pupils are also seen in hallucinogen intoxication
and stimulant intoxication. However, other signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, such
as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cram ps, rhinorrhea, and lacrimation, are not
present. 
Other opioid-ind uced disorders. Opioid withdrawal is distinguished from the other

“In a controlled environment” app lies as a further specifier of remission if the individual is
both in remission and in a controlled environm ent (i.e., in early remission in a controlled
environment or in sustained remission in a controlled environmen t). Examples of these
environments are closely supe rvised and substanc e-free jails, therapeutic communities,
and locked hospital units. 
Diagnostic Features
Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances  include benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-
like drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zaleplon), carb amates (e.g., glutethimide, meprobamate),
barbiturates (e.g., secobarbital), and barbitur ate-like hypnotics (e.g ., glutethimide, meth-
aqualone). This class of substances includes  all prescription slee ping medications and
almost all prescription antianxiety medica tions. Nonbenzodiazep ine antianxiety agents
(e.g., buspirone, gepirone) are not included in this class because they do not appear to be
associated with significant misuse",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,597
"Like alcohol, these agents are brain depressants and can produce similar substance/
medication-induced and substa nce use disorders. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic sub-
stances are available both by prescription an d illegally. Some individuals who obtain these
substances by prescription will develop a seda tive, hypnotic, or anxi olytic use disorder,
while others who misuse these substances or use them for intoxicati on will not develop a
use disorder. In particular, sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics with rapid onset and/or
short to intermediate lengths of action may be taken for intoxicati on purposes, although
longer acting substances in this clas s may be taken for intoxication as well",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,597
"Craving (Criterion A4), either while using or during a period of abstinence, is a typical
feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. Misuse of substances from this
class may occur on its own or in conjunction with use of other substances. For example, in-
dividuals may use intoxicating doses of se datives or benzodiaze pines to “come down”
from cocaine or amphetamines or use high doses of benzodiazepines in combination with
methadone to “boost” its effects. 
Repeated absences or poor work performance, school absences, suspensions or expul-
sions, and neglect of children or household (Criterion A5) may be related to sedative, hyp-
notic, or anxiolytic use disorder, as may the continued use of the substances despite
arguments with a spouse abou t consequences of intoxication or despite physical fights
(Criterion A6). Limiting contact with family or  friends, avoiding work or school, or stop-
ping participation in hobbies, sports, or games (Criterion A7) and recurrent sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use when driving an automobile or operatin g a machine when im-
paired by sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic us e (Criterion A8) are also seen in sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,597
"Very significant levels of tolerance and wi thdrawal can develop to the sedative, hyp-
notic, or anxiolytic. There may be evidence of tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of
a diagnosis of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder in an individual who has
abruptly discontinued use of benzodiazepines that were taken for long periods of time at
prescribed and therapeutic doses. In these case s, an additional diagnosis of sedative, hyp-
notic, or anxiolytic use disorder is made only if other criteria are met. That is, sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications may be prescribed for appropriate medical purposes,
and depending on the dose regimen, these drugs may then produce tolerance and with-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,597

drawal. If these drugs are prescribed or recommended for appropriate medical purposes,
and if they are used as prescribed, the result ing tolerance or withdrawal does not meet the
criteria for diagnosing a substance use disord er. However, it is necessary to determine
whether the drugs were appropriately prescribed and used (e.g., falsifying medical symp-
toms to obtain the medication; using more medication than prescribed; obtaining the med-
ication from several doctors without info rming them of the others’ involvement). 
Given the unidimensional nature of the symp toms of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder, severity is based on the number of criteria endorsed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,598
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is often associated with other substance use dis-
orders (e.g., alcohol, cannabis, opioid, stimulant use disorders). Sedatives are often used to al-
leviate the unwanted effects of these other substances. With repeated use of the substance,
tolerance develops to the sedative effects, an d a progressively higher dose is used. However,
tolerance to brain stem depressa nt effects develops much more slowly, and as the individual
takes more substance to achieve euphoria or other desired effects, there may be a sudden onset
of respiratory depression and hypotension, which may result in death. Intense or repeated
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic  intoxication may be associated  with severe de pression that,
although temporary, can lead to suicide attempt and completed suicide. 
Prevalence
The 12-month prevalences of DS M-IV sedative, hypnotic, or an xiolytic use disorder are es-
timated to be 0.3% among 12- to 17-year-ol ds and 0.2% among adults age 18 years and
older. Rates of DSM-IV sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder are slightly greater
among adult males (0.3%) than among adult fe males, but for 12- to 17-year-olds, the rate
for females (0.4%) exceeds that for males (0.2%). The 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder decreases as a function of age and is great-
est among 18- to 29-year-olds (0.5%) and lo west among individuals 65 years and older
(0.04%)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,598
"Twelve-month prevalence of se dative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic  use disorder varies across
racial/ethnic subgroups of the U.S. population . For 12- to 17-year-olds, rates are greatest

icans (0.1%), and Asian Americans and Pacifi c Islanders (0.1%). Among adults, 12-month
prevalence is greatest amon g Native Americans and Alaska Natives (0.8%), with rates of
approximately 0.2% among African Americans, whites, and Hispanics and 0.1% among
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,598
"Development and Course
The usual course of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder involves individuals in
their teens or 20s who escalate  their occasional use of seda tive, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
agents to the point at which they develop prob lems that meet criteria  for a diagnosis. This
pattern may be especially likely among indi viduals who have other substance use disor-
ders (e.g., alcohol, opioids, stimulants). An in itial pattern of intermit tent use socially (e.g.,
at parties) can lead to daily use and high leve ls of tolerance. Once this occurs, an increasing
level of interpersonal difficulties, as well as increasingly severe episodes of cognitive dys-
function and physiological wi thdrawal, can be expected",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,598
"The second and less frequently  observed clinical course begins with an individual who
originally obtained the medication by prescrip tion from a physician, usually for the treat-
ment of anxiety, insomnia, or somatic complain ts. As either tolerance or a need for higher
doses of the medication develops, there is a gr adual increase in the dose and frequency of
self-administration. The individu al is likely to continue to justify use on the basis of his or
her original symptoms of anxiety or insomn ia, but substance-seeking behavior becomes",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,598

more prominent, and the individual may seek out multiple physicians to obtain sufficient
supplies of the medication. Tolerance can reach high levels, and withdrawal (including
seizures and withdrawal  delirium) may occur. 
As with many substance use disorders, sedati ve, hypnotic, or anxiol ytic use disorder gen-
erally has an onset during adolescence or early adult life. There is an increased risk for misuse
and problems from many psychoactive substances  as individuals age. In particular, cognitive
impairment increases as a side effect with ag e, and the metabolism of sedatives, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics decreases with age among older indi viduals. Both acute and chronic toxic effects
of these substances, especially effects on co gnition, memory, and motor coordination, are
likely to increase with age as a consequence of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic age-
related changes. Individuals with major neuroc ognitive disorder (dementia) are more likely
to develop intoxication and impaired phy siological functioning at lower doses",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,599
"Deliberate intoxication to achieve a “high” is  most likely to be observed in teenagers
and individuals in their 20s. Problems associate d with sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics
are also seen in individuals in their 40s and older who escalate the dose of prescribed med-
ications. In older individuals, intoxicati on can resemble a progressive dementia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,599
"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Impulsivity and novelty seeking are in dividual temperaments that re-
late to the propensity to develop a substanc e use disorder but may themselves be geneti-
cally determined. 
Environmental. Since sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are all pharmaceuticals, a key
risk factor relates to availability of the substances. In the United States, the historical pat-
terns of sedative, hypn otic, or anxiolytic misuse relate to the broad prescribing patterns",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,599
"For instance, a marked decrease in prescription  of barbiturates was associated with an in-
crease in benzodiazepine pres cribing. Peer factors may rela te to genetic predisposition in
terms of how individuals select  their environment. Other individuals at heightened risk
might include those with alcohol use disorder who may receive repeated prescriptions in
response to their complaints of al cohol-related anxiety or insomnia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,599
"Genetic and physiological. As for other substance use diso rders, the risk for sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder can be re lated to individual, family, peer, social, and
environmental factors. Within these domains, genetic factors play a particularly important
role both directly and indirectly. Overall, ac ross development, genetic factors seem to play
a larger role in the onset of sedative, hypnotic,  or anxiolytic use disorder as individuals age
through puberty into adult life.

ing a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,599

after the use of long-acting substa nces, such as diazepam or flurazepam",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,600
"Functional Consequences of 
Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder
The social and interpersonal co nsequences of sedative, hypnot ic, or anxiolytic use disorder
mimic those of alcohol in terms of the potentia l for disinhibited behavior. Accidents, interper-
sonal difficulties (such as argume nts or fights), and interference  with work or school perfor-
mance are all common outcomes. Physical examinat ion is likely to reveal evidence of a mild
decrease in most aspects of autonomic nervous system functioning, including a slower pulse,
a slightly decreased respiratory rate, and a slight  drop in blood pressure (most likely to occur
with postural changes). At high doses, sedative, hypnotic, or an xiolytic substances can be le-
thal, particularly when mixed with alcohol, al though the lethal dosage varies considerably
among the specific substances. Overdoses may be associated with a deterioration in vital signs
that signals an impending medical emergency (e .g., respiratory arrest  from barbiturates)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,600
"There may be consequences of trauma (e.g., internal bleeding or a subdural hematoma) from
accidents that occur while intoxicated. Intraven ous use of these substances can result in med-
ical complications related to the use of contaminated needles (e.g., hepatitis and HIV). 
Acute intoxication can result in accidental injuries and automobile accidents. For elderly
individuals, even short-term use of these sedati ng medications at prescr ibed doses can be as-
sociated with an increased risk for cognitive problems and falls. The disinhibiting effects of
these agents, like alcohol, may potentially cont ribute to overly aggressive behavior, with sub-
sequent interpersonal and legal problems. Accide ntal or deliberate overdoses, similar to those
observed for alcohol use disorder or repeated alcohol intoxication, can occur. In contrast to
their wide margin of safety when used alone,  benzodiazepines taken in combination with al-
cohol can be particularly dangerous, and accidental overdoses are reported commonly. Acci-
dental overdoses have also been  reported in individuals who deliberately misuse barbiturates
and other nonbenzodiazepine sedatives (e.g., me thaqualone), but since these agents are much
less available than the benzodiazepines, the freq uency of overdosing is  low in most settings",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,600
"Differential Diagnosis
Other mental disorders or medical conditions. Individuals with se dative-, hypnotic-,
or anxiolytic-induced disorders may present with symptoms (e.g., anxiety) that resemble
primary mental disorders (e.g., generalized an xiety disorder vs. sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder, with on set during withdrawal). The slurred speech,
incoordination, and other associa ted features characteristic of sedative, hypnotic, or anx-

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication is the presence of clini-
cally significant maladaptive behavioral or ps ychological changes (e.g ., inappropriate sexual
or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impair ed judgment, impaired social or occupational
functioning) that develo p during, or shortly after, use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
(Criteria A and B). As with other brain depressants, such as alcohol, these behaviors may be ac-
companied by slurred speech, incoordination (at le vels that can interfere with driving abilities
and with performing usual activities to the poin t of causing falls or automobile accidents), an
unsteady gait, nystagmus, impairment in cogn ition (e.g., attentional or memory problems),
and stupor or coma (Criterion C). Memory impa irment is a prominent feature of sedative, hyp-
notic, or anxiolytic intoxication and is most often characterized by an  anterograde amnesia that
resembles “alcoholic blackouts,” which can be  disturbing to the individual. The symptoms
must not be attributable to another medical co ndition and are not better explained by another",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,601

substances by prescription, are borrowing the medi cation from friends or relatives, or are de-
liberately taking the substance to achieve intoxication",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,602
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Associated features include taking more medi cation than prescribed, taking multiple dif-
ferent medications, or mixing sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic agents with alcohol, which
can markedly increase the effects of these agents. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxi olytic intoxication in the general population
is unclear. However, it is probable that most  nonmedical users of sedatives, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics would at some time have signs or  symptoms that meet criteria for sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; if so, then the prevalence of nonmedical sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use in the general po pulation may be simila r to the prevalence of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxicati on. For example, tranquilizers are used non-
medically by 2.2% of Amer icans older than 12 years. 
Differential Diagnosis
Alcohol use disorders. Since the clinical presentations may be identical, distinguishing sed-
ative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication from  alcohol use disorders requires evidence for re-
cent ingestion of sedative, hypnot ic, or anxiolytic medications by  self-report, informant report,
or toxicological testing. Many individuals who misuse sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may
also misuse alcohol and other su bstances, and so multiple intoxi cation diagnoses are possible.

disturbances. For sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal without perceptual distur-
bances, the ICD-10-CM code is F13.239.  For sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal
with perceptual disturbances, the ICD-10-CM code is F13.232.  Note that the ICD-10-CM
codes indicate the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anx-
iolytic use disorder, reflecting the fact that sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal can
only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal is the presence of a char-
acteristic syndrome that develops  after a marked decrease in or cessation of intake after several
weeks or more of regular use (C riteria A and B). This withdrawal  syndrome is characterized by
two or more symptoms (similar to alcohol with drawal) that include au tonomic hyperactivity
(e.g., increases in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, or body temperature, along with
sweating); a tremor of the hands; insomnia ; nausea, sometimes accompanied by vomiting;
anxiety; and psychomotor agitation. A grand mal seizure may occur in perhaps as many as
20%–30% of individuals undergoing untreated withdrawal from these substances. In severe
withdrawal, visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illus ions can occur but are usually in
the context of a delirium. If the individual’s rea lity testing is intact (i.e., he or she knows the
substance is causing the hallucinations) and the illusions occur in a clear sensorium, the spec-
ifier “with perceptual disturbances” can be note d. When hallucinations occur in the absence of
intact reality testing, a diagnosis of substanc e/medication-induced ps ychotic disorder should
be considered. The symptoms cause clinically si gnificant distress or impairment in social, oc-
cupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be
attributable to anothe r medical condition and are not bette r explained by an other mental dis-
order (e.g., alcohol withdrawal or generalized anxiety disorder) (Criterion D). Relief of with-
drawal symptoms with admini stration of any sedative-hypnotic agent would support a
diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,603
"Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal 559
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
The timing and severity of the withdrawal sy ndrome will differ depending on the specific
substance and its pharmacokinetics and ph armacodynamics. For example, withdrawal
from shorter-acting substances that are rapidl y absorbed and that have no active metabo-
lites (e.g., triazolam) can begi n within hours after the subs tance is stopped; withdrawal
from substances with long-acting metabolites  (e.g., diazepam) may not begin for 1–2 days
or longer. The withdrawal syndrome produced by substances in this class may be charac-
terized by the development of a delirium that  can be life-threatening. There may be evi-
dence of tolerance and withdr awal in the absence of a diagnosis of a substance use
disorder in an individual who has abruptly discontinued benzodiazepines that were taken
for long periods of time at prescribed and therapeutic doses. Howe ver, ICD-10-CM codes
only allow a diagnosis of seda tive, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal in the presence of
comorbid moderate to severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,604
"The time course of the withdr awal syndrome is generally predicted by the half-life of
the substance. Medications whose actions typica lly last about 10 hours or less (e.g., loraz-
epam, oxazepam, temazepam) produce withdr awal symptoms within 6–8 hours of de-
creasing blood levels that peak in intensity on the second day and improve markedly by
the fourth or fifth day. For substances with  longer half-lives (e .g., diazepam), symptoms
may not develop for more than 1 week, peak in  intensity during the second week, and de-
crease markedly during the third or fourth week. There may be additional longer-term
symptoms at a much lower level of inte nsity that persist for several months",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,604
"The longer the substance has been taken and the higher the dosages used, the more likely
it is that there will be severe withdrawal. However, withdrawal has been reported with as little
as 15 mg of diazepam (or its eq uivalent in other benzodiazepines) when taken daily for several
months. Doses of approximately 40 mg of diazepa m (or its equivalent) daily are more likely to
produce clinically relevant withdrawal symptoms, and even higher doses (e.g., 100 mg of di-
azepam) are more likely to be followed by withdrawal seizures or delirium. Sedative, hyp-
notic, or anxiolytic withdrawal delirium is ch aracterized by disturbances in consciousness and
cognition, with visual, tactile, or auditory ha llucinations. When present, sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal delirium should be diagnosed instead of withdrawal",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,604
"Prevalence 
The prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal is unclear. 
Diagnostic Markers
Seizures and autonomic instability in the setting of a history of prolonged exposure to sed-
ative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications su ggest a high likelihood of sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic withdrawal. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other medical disorders. The symptoms of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic with-
drawal may be mimicked by other medical cond itions (e.g., hypoglyc emia, diabetic keto-
acidosis). If seizures are a feature of the seda tive, hypnotic, or anxi olytic withdrawal, the
differential diagnosis includes the various causes  of seizures (e.g., infections, head injury,
poisonings). 
Essential tremor. Essential tremor, a disorder that frequently runs in families, may
erroneously suggest the tremulousness associat ed with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal. 
Alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol withdrawal produces a sy ndrome very similar to that of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,604

from the underlying anxiety disorder can be difficult. As with alco hol, lingering with-

Specifiers
“In a controlled environment” app lies as a further specifier of remission if the individual is
both in remission and in a controlled environm ent (i.e., in early remission in a controlled
environment or in sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supe rvised and substanc e-free jails, therapeutic communities,
and locked hospital units. 
Diagnostic Features
The amphetamine and amphetamine-type stimul ants include substances with a substi-
tuted-phenylethylamine struct ure, such as amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and meth-
amphetamine. Also included are those substanc es that are structura lly different but have
similar effects, such as methylphenidate. These substances are usually taken orally or in-
travenously, although methamphetamine is also  taken by the nasal route. In addition to
the synthetic amphetamine-type compounds, th ere are naturally occurring, plant-derived
stimulants such as khât.  Amphetamines and other stimulants  may be obtained by prescrip-
tion for the treatment of obesity, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and narcolepsy",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,608
"Consequently, prescribed stimul ants may be diverted into the illegal market. The effects of
amphetamines and amphetamine-like drugs are sim ilar to those of cocaine, such that the
criteria for stimulant use disord er are presented here as a sing le disorder with the ability to
specify the particular stimulant used by the individual. Cocaine may be consumed in sev-
eral preparations (e.g., coca leaves, coca pa ste, cocaine hydrochloride, and cocaine alka-
loids such as freebase and crack) that differ in  potency because of varying levels of purity
and speed of onset. However, in all forms of the substance, cocaine is the active ingredient",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,608
"Cocaine hydrochloride powder is usually “snorted” through the nostrils or dissolved in
water and injected intravenously",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,608
"Individuals exposed to amphetamine-type stimulants or cocaine can develop stimu-
lant use disorder as rapidly as  1 week, although the onset is  not always th is rapid. Re-
gardless of the route of administration, tole rance occurs with repeated use. Withdrawal
symptoms, particularly hypersomnia, increa sed appetite, and dysphoria, can occur and
can enhance craving. Most individuals with stimulant use disorder have experienced tol-
erance or withdrawal. 
Use patterns and course are similar for di sorders involving amphetamine-type stimu-
lants and cocaine, as both substances are po tent central nervous system stimulants with
similar psychoactive and sympathomimetic effects. Amphetamine-type stimulants are
longer acting than cocaine and thus are used fewer times per day. Usage may be chronic or
episodic, with binges punctuated by brief no n-use periods. Aggressive or violent behavior
is common when high doses are smoked, ingested, or administered intravenously. Intense
temporary anxiety resembling panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, as well as
paranoid ideation and psychotic episodes that resemble schizophrenia, is seen with high-
dose use",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,608
"Withdrawal states are associated with temporary but intense depressive symptoms that
can resemble a major depressive episode; the depressive symptoms usually resolve within
1 week. Tolerance to amphetamine -type stimulants develops and leads to escalation of the
dose. Conversely, some users of amphetami ne-type stimulants develop sensitization,
characterized by enhanced effects",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,608

"564 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Individuals with acute intoxication may pr esent with rambling speech, headache, tran-
sient ideas of reference, and tinnitus. There may be paranoid ideati on, auditory halluci-
nations in a clear sensorium, and tactile hallucinations, which the individual usually
recognizes as drug effects. Thre ats or acting out of aggressive  behavior may occur. Depres-
sion, suicidal ideation, irritability, anhedonia,  emotional lability, or disturbances in atten-
tion and concentration commonly occur during withdrawal. Mental disturbances associated
with cocaine use usually resolve hours to days  after cessation of use but can persist for
1 month. Physiological changes during stimulant withdrawal ar e opposite to those of the
intoxication phase, sometimes including bradycardia. Temporary depressive symptoms
may meet symptomatic and duration criteria for major depressive episode. Histories con-
sistent with repeated panic attacks, social an xiety disorder (social phobia)–like behavior,
and generalized anxiety–like syndromes are co mmon, as are eating disorders. One ex-
treme instance of stimulant toxicity is st imulant-induced psychotic disorder, a disorder
that resembles schizophrenia, with delusions and hallucinations. 
Individuals with stimulant use disorder of ten develop conditioned responses to drug-

Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Comorbid bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, antisocial personality disor-
der, and other substance use disorders are risk  factors for developing stimulant use disorder

"Functional Consequences of  Stimulant Use Disorder 
Various medical conditions may occur dependin g on the route of administration. Intrana-
sal users often develop sinusitis, irritation, bl eeding of the nasal mucosa, and a perforated
nasal septum. Individuals who smoke the drugs are at increased risk for respiratory prob-
lems (e.g., coughing, bronchitis, and pneumonitis). Injectors have puncture marks and
“tracks,” most commonly on their forearms. Ri sk of HIV infection increases with frequent
intravenous injections and unsafe sexual acti vity. Other sexually transmitted diseases,
hepatitis, and tuberculosis and other lung infections are also seen . Weight loss and mal-
nutrition are common. 
Chest pain may be a common symptom during stimulant intoxication. Myocardial in-
farction, palpitations and arrhythmias, sudden  death from respiratory or cardiac arrest,
and stroke have been associated with stimulant use among young and otherwise healthy
individuals. Seizures can occur with stimulant use. Pneumothorax can result from per-
forming Valsalva-like maneuvers done to better absorb inhaled smoke. Traumatic injuries
due to violent behavior are common among in dividuals trafficking drugs. Cocaine use is
associated with irregularities in placental bl ood flow, abruptio placentae, premature labor
and delivery, and an increased prevalence of infants with very low birth weights",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,611
"Individuals with stimulant use disorder may become involved in theft, prostitution, or
drug dealing in order to acquire drugs or money for drugs. 
Neurocognitive impairment is common am ong methamphetamine users. Oral health
problems include “meth mouth” with gum dise ase, tooth decay, and mouth sores related
to the toxic effects of smoking the drug and to bruxism while intoxicated. Adverse pulmo-
nary effects appear to be le ss common for amphetamine-type  stimulants because they are
smoked fewer times per day. Emergency department visits are common for stimulant-re-
lated mental disorder symptoms, injury, skin infections, and dental pathology. 
Differential Diagnosis
Primary mental disorders. Stimulant-induced disorders may resemble primary mental
disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder) (for discussion of th is differential diagnosis, see
“Stimulant Withdrawal”). The mental disturbanc es resulting from the effects of stimulants
should be distinguished from  the symptoms of schizophrenia; depressive and bipolar dis-
orders; generalized anxiety disorder; and panic disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,611
"Phencyclidine intoxication. Intoxication with phencyclidine (“PCP” or “angel dust”) or
synthetic “designer drugs” such as mephedrone (known by different names, including
“bath salts”) may cause a similar clinical pict ure and can only be di stinguished from stim-
ulant intoxication by the presence of coca ine or amphetamine-type substance metabolites
in a urine or plasma sample. 
Stimulant intoxication and withdrawal. Stimulant intoxication and withdrawal are dis-
tinguished from the other stimulant-induced di sorders (e.g., anxiety disorder, with onset
during intoxication) because the symptoms in the latter disorders predominate the clinical
presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,611

somnia, nervousness, and other unpleasant side effects. Cocaine users often use alcohol,
while amphetamine-type stimulant users ofte n use cannabis. Stimulant use disorder may
be associated with posttraumatic stress diso rder, antisocial personality disorder, atten-
tion-deficit/hyperacti vity disorder, and gambling di sorder. Cardiopulmonary problems
are often present in individuals seeking treatm ent for cocaine-related problems, with chest
pain being the most common. Medical problems occur in response to adulterants used as
“cutting” agents. Cocaine users who ingest co caine cut with levamisole, an antimicrobial
and veterinary medication, may experience agranulocytosis and febrile neutropenia.

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of stimulant intoxicati on, related to amphetamine-type stimulants
and cocaine, is the presence of clinically significant behavioral or psychological changes
that develop during, or shortly after, use of stimulants (Criteria A and B). Auditory hallu-
cinations may be prominent, as may paranoid  ideation, and these symptoms must be dis-
tinguished from an independent psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. Stimulant
intoxication usually begins with a “high” f eeling and includes one or more of the follow-
ing: euphoria with enhanced vigor, gregarious ness, hyperactivity, restlessness, hypervig-
ilance, interpersonal sensitivity, talkativenes s, anxiety, tension, alertness, grandiosity,
stereotyped and repetitive behavior, anger, impaired judgment, and, in the case of chronic
intoxication, affective blunting with fatigue or sadness and social withdrawal. These be-
havioral and psychological changes are acco mpanied by two or more of the following
signs and symptoms that develop during or sh ortly after stimulant us e: tachycardia or bra-
dycardia; pupillary dilation; el evated or lowered blood pressu re; perspiration or chills;
nausea or vomiting; evidence of weight loss ; psychomotor agitation or retardation; mus-
cular weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or card iac arrhythmias; and confu-
sion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma  (Criterion C). Intoxi cation, either acute or
chronic, is often associated with impaired so cial or occupational functioning. Severe in-
toxication can lead to convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperpyrexia, and death. For the
diagnosis of stimulant intoxica tion to be made, the symptoms must not be attributable
to another medical condition and not better explained by anot her mental disorder (Crite-
rion D). While stimulant intoxica tion occurs in individuals with stimulant use disorders, in-
toxication is not a criterion for stimulant us e disorder, which is confirmed by the presence
of two of the 11 diagnostic criteria for use disorder. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
The magnitude and direction of the behavioral  and physiological changes depend on many
variables, including the dose used and the ch aracteristics of the individual using the sub-
stance or the context (e.g., tolerance, rate of absorption, chronicity of use, context in which
it is taken). Stimulant effects such as eupho ria, increased pulse an d blood pressure, and
psychomotor activity are most commonly seen . Depressant effects such as sadness, brady-
cardia, decreased blood pressure, and decr eased psychomotor activity are less common
and generally emerge only wi th chronic high-dose use. 
Differential Diagnosis
Stimulant-induced disorders. Stimulant intoxication is distinguished from the other
stimulant-induced disorders (e.g., stimulant- induced depressive di sorder, bipolar disor-
der, psychotic disorder, anxiety disorder) because the severity of the intoxication symp-
toms exceeds that associated with the stim ulant-induced disorders, and the symptoms
warrant independent clinical attention. Stimulant intoxication delirium would be distin-
guished by a disturbance in level of  awareness and change in cognition.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,613
"Stimulant Withdrawal 569

The essential feature of stimulant withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic with-
drawal syndrome that develops within a few hours to several days after the cessation of
(or marked reduction in) stimulant use (genera lly high dose) that has been prolonged (Cri-
terion A). The withdrawal syndrome is char acterized by the development of dysphoric
mood accompanied by two or more of the fo llowing physiological changes: fatigue, vivid
and unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypers omnia, increased appetite, and psychomotor
retardation or agitation (Crite rion B). Bradycardia is often present and is a reliable mea-

tained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these environments are closely su-
pervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units. 
Diagnostic Features
Tobacco use disorder is common among individu als who use cigarettes and smokeless to-
bacco daily and is uncommon among individuals who do not use tobacco daily or who use
nicotine medications. Tolerance to tobacco is exemplified by the disappearance of nausea
and dizziness after repeated intake and with a more intense effect of tobacco the first time
it is used during the day. Cessation of to bacco use can produce a well-defined withdrawal
syndrome. Many individuals with tobacco use disorder use tobacco to relieve or to avoid
withdrawal symptoms (e.g., after being in a sit uation where use is restricted). Many indi-
viduals who use tobacco have tobacco-relat ed physical symptoms or diseases and con-
tinue to smoke. The large majority report crav ing when they do not smoke for several hours",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,617
"Spending excessive time usin g tobacco can be exemplified by chain-smoking (i.e., smok-
ing one cigarette after another with no time between cigarettes). Because tobacco sources
are readily and legally available, and because nicotine intoxication is very rare, spending a
great deal of time attempting to procure toba cco or recovering from its effects is uncom-
mon. Giving up important social, occupational , or recreational acti vities can occur when
an individual forgoes an activity because it occurs in tobacco use–restricted areas. Use of
tobacco rarely results in failu re to fulfill major role obligat ions (e.g., in terference with
work, interference with home obligations), bu t persistent social or interpersonal problems
(e.g., having arguments with others about to bacco use, avoiding social situations because
of others’ disapproval of tobacco use) or use that is physically hazardous (e.g., smoking in",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,617

and waking at night to smoke are associated with tobacco use di sorder. Environmental
cues can evoke craving and withdrawal. Serious medical conditions, such as lung and
other cancers, cardiac and pulmonary disease , perinatal problems, cough, shortness of
breath, and accelerated skin aging, often occur",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,618
"Prevalence
Cigarettes are the most commonly used toba cco product, representing over 90% of to-
bacco/nicotine use. In the United States, 57% of adults have never been smokers, 22% are
former smokers, and 21% are current smokers.  Approximately 20% of current U.S. smok-
ers are nondaily smokers. The prevalence of sm okeless tobacco use is less than 5%, and the
prevalence of tobacco use in pipes and cigars is less than 1%. 
DSM-IV nicotine dependence criteria can be used to estimate the prevalence of tobacco
use disorder, but since they are a subset of to bacco use disorder criteria, the prevalence of
tobacco use disorder will be somewhat greater. The 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV nic-
otine dependence in the United States is 13% among adults age 18 years and older. Rates
are similar among adult males (14%) and fe males (12%) and decline in age from 17%
among 18- to 29-year-old s to 4% among individuals age 65 years and older. The prevalence
of current nicotine dependence is greate r among Native American and Alaska Natives
(23%) than among whites (14%) but is less am ong African Americans (10%), Asian Amer-
icans and Pacific Islanders (6%), and Hispan ics (6%). The prevalence among current daily
smokers is approximately 50%",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,618
"In many developing nations, the prevalence  of smoking is much greater in males than
in females, but this is not the case in develope d nations. However, ther e often is a lag in the
demographic transition such that smoking increases in females at a later time. 
Development and Course
The majority of U.S. adolescents experiment with tobacco use, and by age 18 years, about
20% smoke at least monthly. Most of these in dividuals become daily tobacco users. Initi-
ation of smoking after age 21 years is rare. In general, some of the to bacco use disorder cri-
teria symptoms occur soon after beginning to bacco use, and many individuals’ pattern of
use meets current tobacco use diso rder criteria by late adolescence. More than 80% of in-
dividuals who use tobacco atte mpt to quit at some time, but 60% relapse within 1 week
and less than 5% remain abstinent for life . However, most indivi duals who use tobacco
make multiple attempts such that one-half of  tobacco users eventually abstain. Individuals
who use tobacco who do quit usually do not do  so until after age 30 years. Although non-
daily smoking in the United States was previ ously rare, it has beco me more prevalent in
the last decade, especially among younger individuals who use tobacco. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Individuals with externalizing pers onality traits are more likely to
initiate tobacco use. Children with attentio n-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or conduct
disorder, and adults with depr essive, bipolar, anxiety, pers onality, psychotic, or other
substance use disorders, are at higher risk of starting and continuing tobacco use and of to-
bacco use disorder.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,618

continuation of tobacco use, and the developm ent of tobacco use disorder, with a degree of
heritability equivalent to that observed with other substance use disorders (i.e., about
50%). Some of this risk is specific to toba cco, and some is common with the vulnerability to
developing any substance use disorder. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
Cultures and subcultures vary widely in their acceptance of the use of tobacco. The prev-
alence of tobacco use declined in the United  States from the 1960s through the 1990s, but
this decrease has been less evident in Africa n American and Hispanic populations. Also,
smoking in developing countries is more prev alent than in developed nations. The degree
to which these cultural differences are due to  income, education, and tobacco control ac-
tivities in a country is unclear. Non-Hispan ic white smokers appear to be more likely to
develop tobacco use disorder than are smoker s. Some ethnic differences may be biologi-
cally based. African American males tend to have higher nicotine blood levels for a given
number of cigarettes, and this might contribute  to greater difficulty in quitting. Also, the
speed of nicotine metabolism is significantly different for whites compared with African
Americans and can vary by genotypes associated with ethnicities",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,619
"Diagnostic Markers
Carbon monoxide in the breath, and nicotine and its metabolite cotinine in blood, saliva, or
urine, can be used to measure the extent of cu rrent tobacco or nicotine use; however, these
are only weakly related to tobacco use disorder. 
Functional Consequences of Tobacco Use Disorder
Medical consequences of tobacco use often be gin when tobacco users are in their 40s and
usually become progressively more debilitat ing over time. One-half of smokers who do
not stop using tobacco will die early from a tobacco-related illness, and smoking-related
morbidity occurs in more than one-half of tobacco users. Most medical conditions result
from exposure to carbon monoxide, tars, an d other non-nicotine components of tobacco",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,619
"The major predictor of reversibility is duration of smoking. Secondhand smoke increases
the risk of heart disease and cancer by 30%. Long-term use of nicotine medications does
not appear to cause medical harm. 
Comorbidity
The most common medical diseases from smoking are cardiovascular illnesses, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancers. Smoking also increases perinatal problems,
such as low birth weight and miscarriage. Th e most common psychiat ric comorbidities are
alcohol/substance, depressive, bipolar, anxiet y, personality, and attention-deficit/hyper-
activity disorders. In individuals with curren t tobacco use disorder, the prevalence of cur-
rent alcohol, drug, anxiety, depressive, bi polar, and personality disorders ranges from
22% to 32%. Nicotine-dependent smokers are 2.7–8.1 times more likely to have these dis-
orders than nondependent smokers, never-smokers, or ex-smokers.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,619

"B. Abrupt cessation of tobacco use, or reduction in the amount of tobacco used, followed
within 24 hours by four (or more) of the following signs or symptoms:
1. Irritability, frustration, or anger",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,620

ter explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from an-
other substance",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,620
"Coding note:  The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for tobacco withdrawal
is F17.203. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate
or severe tobacco use disorder, reflecting the fact that tobacco withdrawal can only occur
in the presence of a moderate or severe toba cco use disorder. It is not permissible to code
a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder with tobacco withdrawal",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,620
"Diagnostic Features
Withdrawal symptoms impair the ability to st op tobacco use. The symptoms after absti-
nence from tobacco are in large part due to nicotine deprivation. Symptoms are much
more intense among individuals who smoke cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco than
among those who use nicotine medications. This difference in symptom intensity is likely
due to the more rapid onset and higher levels of nicotine with cigarette smoking. Tobacco
withdrawal is common among daily tobacco users who stop or reduce but can also occur
among nondaily users. Typically, heart rate decreases by 5–12 beats per minute in the first
few days after stopping smoking, and weight increases an average of 4–7 lb (2–3 kg) over
the first year after stopping smoking. Tobacco withdrawal can produce clinically signifi-
cant mood changes and functional impairment. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Craving for sweet or sugary foods and impaired performance on tasks requiring vigilance
are associated with tobacco withdrawal. Abstinence can increase constipation, coughing,
dizziness, dreaming/nightmare s, nausea, and sore throat. Smoking increases the metab-
olism of many medications used to treat mental disorders; thus, cessation of smoking can
increase the blood levels of these medications, and this can produce clinically significant
outcomes. This effect appears to be due not to nicotine but rather  to other compounds in
tobacco. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,620
"576 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
Prevalence
Approximately 50% of tobacco users who quit for 2 or more days will have symptoms that
meet criteria for tobacco withdrawal. The most commonly endorsed signs and symptoms
are anxiety, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. The least commonly endorsed symp-
toms are depression and insomnia. 
Development and Course
Tobacco withdrawal usually begins within 24 hours of stopping or cutting down on to-
bacco use, peaks at 2–3 days after abstinence, and lasts 2–3 weeks. Tobacco withdrawal
symptoms can occur among adolescent tobacco users, even prior to daily tobacco use. Pro-
longed symptoms beyond 1 month are uncommon. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Temperamental. Smokers with depressive disorders,  bipolar disorders, anxiety disor-
ders, attention-deficit/hypera ctivity disorder, and other substance use disorders have
more severe withdrawal",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,621
"Genetic and physiological. Genotype can influence the probability of withdrawal upon
abstinence. 
Diagnostic Markers
Carbon monoxide in the breath, and nicotine and its metabolite cotinine in blood, saliva, or
urine, can be used to measure the extent of tobacco or nicotine use but are only weakly re-
lated to tobacco withdrawal",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,621
"Functional Consequences  of Tobacco Withdrawal
Abstinence from cigarettes can cause clinically significant distress. Withdrawal impairs
the ability to stop or control tobacco use. Whether tobacco withdraw al can prompt a new
mental disorder or recurrence of  a mental disorder is debatable,  but if this occurs, it would
be in a small minority of tobacco users. 
Differential Diagnosis
The symptoms of tobacco with drawal overlap with those of other substance withdrawal
syndromes (e.g., alcohol withdrawal; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; stim-
ulant withdrawal; caffeine withdrawal; opioid withdrawal); caffeine intoxication; anxiety,
depressive, bipolar, and sleep disorders; an d medication-induced akathisia. Admission to
smoke-free inpatient units or voluntary smoking cessation ca n induce withdrawal symp-
toms that mimic, intensify, or disguise othe r disorders or adverse effects of medications
used to treat mental disorders (e.g., irritabi lity thought to be du e to alcohol withdrawal
could be due to tobacco with drawal). Reduction in sympto ms with the use of nicotine
medications confirms the diagnosis.

(including amphetamine and cocaine); or tobacco. Such substances include anabolic ste-
roids; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; cortisol; antiparkinsoni an medications; an-
tihistamines; nitrous oxide; amyl-, butyl-, or isobutyl-nitrites; betel nut, which is chewed
in many cultures to produce mild euphoria an d a floating sensation;  kava (from a South
Pacific pepper plant), which produces sedation , incoordination, weight loss, mild hepati-
tis, and lung abnormalities; or cathinones (including khât plant agents and synthetic chem-
ical derivatives) that produce stimulant effe cts. Unknown substance- related disorders are

"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
A diagnosis of other (or unknown) substance us e disorder is supporte d by the individual’s
statement that the substance involved is not among the nine classes listed in this chapter; by re-
curring episodes of intoxication with negative results in standard drug  screens (which may not

identified substance that has newly appeared in the individual’s community",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,624
"Because of increased access to nitrous oxide (“laughing ga s”), membership in certain
populations is associated with diagnosis of ni trous oxide use disorder. The role of this gas
as an anesthetic agent leads to misuse by so me medical and dental professionals. Its use as
a propellant for commercial products (e.g., whipped cream dispensers) contributes to
misuse by food service workers. With recent  widespread availability of the substance in
“whippet” cartridges for use in home whipped cream dispensers, ni trous oxide misuse by
adolescents and young adults is significant, especially among those who also inhale vola-
tile hydrocarbons. Some continuously usin g individuals, inhaling from as many as 240
whippets per day, may present with serious medical complications and mental conditions,
including myeloneuropathy, spinal cord su bacute combined degeneration, peripheral
neuropathy, and psychosis. These conditions are also associated with a diagnosis of ni-
trous oxide use disorder. 
Use of amyl-, butyl-, and iso butyl nitrite gases has been  observed among homosexual
men and some adolescents, especially those with conduct disorder. Membership in these
populations may be associated with a diagnosis of amyl-, butyl-, or is obutyl-nitrite use dis-
order. However, it has not been determined that these substances produce a substance use

whether the individual has experienced a similar episode after using substances with the
same “street” name or from the same source . Similarly, hospital emergency departments
sometimes recognize over a few days numerous presentations of a severe, unfamiliar in-
toxication syndrome from a newly available,  previously unknown substance. Because of
the great variety of intoxicating substances, Criterion B can provide only broad examples

substances used by pulmonary inhalation and intravenous injection have the most rapid
onset of action, while those ingested by mouth and requiring metabolism to an active
product are much slower. (For example, after ingestion of certain mushrooms, the first
signs of an eventually fatal intoxication may not appear for a few days.) Intoxication ef-
fects usually resolve within hours to a very  few days. However, the body may completely
eliminate an anesthetic gas such as nitrous ox ide just minutes after use ends. At the other
extreme, some “hit-and-run” intoxicating su bstances poison systems, leaving permanent
impairments. For example, MPTP (1-methyl- 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), a con-
taminating by-product in the synthesis of a certain opioid, kills dopaminergic cells and in-
duces permanent parkinsonism in user s who sought opioid intoxication.

"Diagnostic Features
Other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is a clinically significant mental disorder that
develops during, or within a few hours to days  after, reducing or terminating dosing with
a substance (Criteria A and B). Although recent  dose reduction or termination usually is
clear in the history, other diagnostic procedur es are very challenging if the drug is un-
known. Criterion B requires development of a “substance-specific syndrome” (i.e., the in-
dividual’s signs and sympto ms must correspond with th e known withdrawal syndrome
for the recently stopped drug)—a requirement that rarely can be met with an unknown
substance. Consequently, clinical judgment must guide such decisions when information
is this limited. Criterion D requ ires ruling out other medical conditions, mental disorders,
or withdrawals from familiar substances. When  the substance is known, it should be re-
flected in the name of the disorder upon coding (e.g., betel nut withdrawal)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,628
"Prevalence
The prevalence of other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is unknown",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,628
"Development and Course
Withdrawal signs commonly appe ar some hours after use of the substance is terminated,
but the onset and course vary greatly, depending on the dose typically used by the person
and the rate of elimination of the specific su bstance from the body. At peak severity, with-
drawal symptoms from some substances involve only mode rate levels of discomfort,
whereas withdrawal from other substances may be fatal. Withdrawal-associated dyspho-
ria often motivates relapse to substance us e. Withdrawal symptoms slowly abate over
days, weeks, or months, depending on the particular drug and dose s to which the indi-
vidual became tolerant",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,628

drug craving, anxiety, depre ssion, agitation, psychotic symp toms, or cognitive impairments",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,629
"These consequences may lead to problems such  as dysfunction at work, problems in in-

Severity is based on the number of criteria endorsed. Individuals with mild gambling dis-
order may exhibit only 4–5 of the criteria, with  the most frequently endorsed criteria usu-
ally related to preoccupation with gamb ling and “chasing” losses. Individuals with
moderately severe gambli ng disorder exhibit more of the criteria (i.e., 6–7). Individuals
with the most severe form will exhibit all or mo st of the nine criteria  (i.e., 8–9). Jeopardiz-
ing relationships or career o pportunities due to gambling and relying on others to provide
money for gambling losses are typically the least  often endorsed criteria and most often oc-
cur among those with more severe gambling disorder. Furthermore,  individuals present-
ing for treatment of gambling disorder typically have moderate to severe forms of the
disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,631
"Diagnostic Features
Gambling involves risking something of value in the hopes of obtaining something of
greater value. In many cultur es, individuals gamble on game s and events, and most do so
without experiencing problems. However, so me individuals develo p substantial impair-
ment related to their gambling behaviors. Th e essential feature of gambling disorder is
persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behavior that disrupts personal, family,
and/or vocational pursuits (Criterion A). Gamb ling disorder is defined as a cluster of four
or more of the symptoms listed in Criterion A occurring at any time in the same 12-month
period",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,631
"A pattern of “chasing one’s losses” may deve lop, with an urgent need to keep gam-
bling (often with the placing of larger bets or the taking of greater risks) to undo a loss or
series of losses. The individual may abandon his or her gambling strategy and try to win
back losses all at once. Although many gamblers may “chase” for short periods of time, it
is the frequent, and often long-term, “chase” that is characteristic of gambling disorder
(Criterion A6). Individuals may lie to family members, therapists, or others to conceal the
extent of involvement with gambling; these instances of deceit may also include, but
are not limited to, covering up illegal behaviors such as forgery, fraud, theft, or embez-
zlement to obtain money with which to gamble (Criterion A7). Individuals may also en-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,631

gage in “bailout” behavior, turning to family or others for help with  a desperate financial
situation that was caused by gambling (Criterion A9). 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
Distortions in thinking (e.g., denial, superstitions, a sense of power and control over the
outcome of chance events, overconfidence) ma y be present in individuals with gambling
disorder. Many individuals with gambling diso rder believe that money is both the cause
of and the solution to their problems. Some individuals with gambling disorder are im-
pulsive, competitive, energetic, restless, an d easily bored; they may be overly concerned
with the approval of others and may be gene rous to the point of extravagance when win-
ning. Other individuals with gambling disord er are depressed and lonely, and they may
gamble when feeling helpless, guilty, or depres sed. Up to half of individuals in treatment
for gambling disorder have suicidal ideati on, and about 17% have attempted suicide",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,632
"Prevalence 
The past-year prevalence rate of gambling di sorder is about 0.2%–0.3% in the general pop-
ulation. In the general population, the lifetim e prevalence rate is about 0.4%–1.0%. For fe-
males, the lifetime prevalence rate of gambling disorder is about 0.2%, and for males it is
about 0.6%. The lifetime prevalence of path ological gambling among African Americans is
about 0.9%, among whites about 0.4% , and among Hispanics about 0.3%. 
Development and Course 
The onset of gambling disorder can occur du ring adolescence or young adulthood, but in
other individuals it manifests during middle  or even older adulthood. Generally, gam-
bling disorder develops over the course of years, although the progression appears to be
more rapid in females than in males. Most  individuals who develop a gambling disorder
evidence a pattern of gambling that gradually  increases in both frequency and amount of
wagering. Certainly, milder fo rms can develop into more severe cases. Most individuals
with gambling disorder report that one or tw o types of gambling are most problematic for
them, although some individuals participate in  many forms of gambling. Individuals are
likely to engage in certain types of gambling (e.g., buying scratch tickets daily) more fre-
quently than others (e.g., playing slot machin es or blackjack at the casino weekly). Fre-
quency of gambling can be related more to the type of gambling than to the severity of the
overall gambling disorder. For example, purcha sing a single scratch ticket each day may
not be problematic, while less frequent casino , sports, or card gambling may be part of a
gambling disorder. Similarly, amounts of money spent wagering  are not in themselves in-
dicative of gambling disorder. Some individuals can wager thousands of dollars per
month and not have a problem with gambling, while others may wager much smaller
amounts but experience substantia l gambling-related difficulties. 
Gambling patterns may be regular or episod ic, and gambling disorder can be persis-
tent or in remission. Gambling can increase during periods of stress or depression and
during periods of substance use or abstinen ce. There may be periods of heavy gambling
and severe problems, times of total abstin ence, and periods of nonproblematic gambling",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,632
"Gambling disorder is some times associated with  spontaneous, long-term remissions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,632
"Nevertheless, some individual s underestimate their vulner ability to develop gambling
disorder or to return to gamb ling disorder following remission. When in a period of re-
mission, they may incorrectly assume that th ey will have no problem regulating gambling
and that they may gamble on some forms no nproblematically, only to experience a return
to gambling disorder. 
Early expression of gambling disorder is mo re common among males than among fe-
males. Individuals who begin gambling in yo uth often do so with family members or",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,632

friends. Development of early-life gambling diso rder appears to be associated with impul-
sivity and substance abuse. Many high scho ol and college students who develop gambling
disorder grow out of the disorder over time , although it remains a lifelong problem for
some. Mid- and later-life onse t of gambling disorder is more common among females than
among males. 
There are age and gender variations in the type of gambling activities and the preva-
lence rates of gambling disorder. Gambling d isorder is more common among younger and
middle-age persons than among older adults . Among adolescents and young adults, the
disorder is more prevalent in males than in females. Younger indivi duals prefer different
forms of gambling (e.g., sports betting), while older adults are more likely to develop
problems with slot machine and bingo gamblin g. Although the proportions of individuals
who seek treatment for gambling disorder ar e low across all age groups, younger individ-
uals are especially unlikely to present for treatment. 
Males are more likely to begin gambling earlie r in life and to have a younger age at on-
set of gambling disorder than females, who ar e more likely to begin gambling later in life
and to develop gambling disorder in a shorte r time frame. Females with gambling disor-
der are more likely than males with gambling disorder to have depressive, bipolar, and
anxiety disorders. Females also have a later age at onset of the disorder and seek treatment
sooner, although rates of treatment seekin g are low (<10%) among individuals with gam-
bling disorder regardless of gender. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. Gambling that begins in childhood or early adolescence is associated
with increased rates of gambling disorder. Gambling disorder also appears to aggregate
with antisocial personality disorder, depre ssive and bipolar disorders, and other sub-
stance use disorders, particul arly with alcohol disorders. 
Genetic and physiological. Gambling disorder can aggregate in families, and this effect
appears to relate to both environmental and genetic factors. Gambling problems are more
frequent in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins. Gambling disorder is also more preva-
lent among first-degree relati ves of individuals with modera te to severe alcohol use dis-
order than among the general population",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,633
"Course modifiers. Many individuals, including adolesce nts and young adults, are likely to
resolve their problems with gambling disorder over time, although a strong predictor of
future gambling problems is  prior gambling problems",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,633
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Individuals from specific cultures and races/ethnicities are more likely to participate in
some types of gambling activities than others (e.g., pai gow, cockfights , blackjack, horse rac-
ing). Prevalence rates of gambling disorder are higher among African Americans than
among European Americans, with rates for Hi spanic Americans similar to those of Euro-
pean Americans. Indigenous populations have high prevalence rates of gambling disorder. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Males develop gambling disorder at higher rates than females, alth ough this gender gap
may be narrowing. Males tend to wager on di fferent forms of gambling than females, with
cards, sports, and horse race gambling more prevalent among males, and slot machine and
bingo gambling more common among females.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,633

Functional Consequences  of Gambling Disorder
Areas of psychosocial, health, and mental heal th functioning may be adversely affected by
gambling disorder. Specifically, individuals with  gambling disorder may, because of their
involvement with gambling, jeopardize or lo se important relationships with family mem-
bers or friends. Such problems may occur from repeatedly lying to others to cover up the
extent of gambling or from requesting money that is used for gambling or to pay off gam-
bling debts. Employment or educational activities may likewise be adversely impacted by
gambling disorder; absenteeism or poor work or school performance can occur with gam-
bling disorder, as individuals may gamble duri ng work or school h ours or be preoccupied
with gambling or its adverse co nsequence when they should be working or studying. In-
dividuals with gambling disorder  have poor general health and utilize medical services at
high rates. 
Differential Diagnosis
Nondisordered gambling. Gambling disorder must be distinguished from professional
and social gambling. In professional gambling , risks are limited and discipline is central",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,634
"Social gambling typically occurs with friends or colleagues and lasts for a limited period of
time, with acceptable losses. Some individu als can experience problems associated with
gambling (e.g., short-term chasin g behavior and loss of control) that do not meet the full
criteria for gambling disorder. 
Manic episode. Loss of judgment and excessive gambling may occur during a manic ep-
isode. An additional diagnosis of gambling d isorder should be given only if the gambling
behavior is not better explained by manic ep isodes (e.g., a histor y of maladaptive gam-
bling behavior at times other than during a manic episode). Alternatively, an individual
with gambling disorder may, during a period of gambling, exhibit behavior that resembles
a manic episode, but once the individual is away from the gambling, these manic-like fea-
tures dissipate",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,634
"Personality disorders. Problems with gambling  may occur in individuals with antisocial
personality disorder and other personality disorders. If the criteria are met for both disor-
ders, both can be diagnosed. 
Other medical conditions. Some patients taking dopaminergic medications (e.g., for
Parkinson‘s disease) may expe rience urges to gamble. If such symptoms dissipate when
dopaminergic medications are reduced in dosag e or ceased, then a diagnosis of gambling
disorder would not be indicated. 
Comorbidity
Gambling disorder is associated with poor general health. In addition, some specific med-
ical diagnoses, such as tachycardia and an gina, are more common among individuals with
gambling disorder than in the general popula tion, even when other substance use disor-
ders, including tobacco use disorder, are cont rolled for. Individuals with gambling disor-
der have high rates of comorbidity with ot her mental disorders, such as substance use
disorders, depressive d isorders, anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. In some in-
dividuals, other mental disorders may preced e gambling disorder and be either absent or
present during the manifestat ion of gambling disorder. Gamb ling disorder may also occur
prior to the onset of other ment al disorders, especially anxi ety disorders and substance use
disorders. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,634
"591Neurocognitive
 Disorders
The neurocognitive disorders  (NCDs) (referred to in  DSM-IV as “Dementia,
Delirium, Amnestic, and Other Cognitive Di sorders”) begin with delirium, followed by
the syndromes of major NCD, mild NCD, an d their etiological su btypes. The major or
mild NCD subtypes are NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease; vascular NCD; NCD with Lewy
bodies; NCD due to Parkinso n’s disease; frontotemporal NCD; NCD due to traumatic
brain injury; NCD due to HIV infection; su bstance/medication-induced NCD; NCD due
to Huntington’s disease; NC D due to prion disease; NCD du e to another medical condi-
tion; NCD due to multiple etiologies; and unspecified NCD. The NCD category encom-
passes the group of disorders in which the primar y clinical deficit is in cognitive function,
and that are acquired rather than developmental. Although cognitive deficits are present
in many if not all mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar diso rders), only disorders
whose core features are cognitive are includ ed in the NCD category. The NCDs are those
in which impaired cognition has not been present since birth or very early life, and thus
represents a decline from a previou sly attained level of functioning",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,636
"The NCDs are unique among DSM-5 categories in that these are syndromes for which
the underlying pathology, and frequently the etiology as well, can potentially be deter-
mined. The various underlying disease entities  have all been the subject of extensive re-
search, clinical experience, and expert consen sus on diagnostic crit eria. The DSM-5 criteria
for these disorders have  been developed in close consultation with the expert groups for
each of the disease entities and align as closely as possible with the current consensus cri-
teria for each of them. The potential utility of  biomarkers is also discussed in relation to
diagnosis. Dementia is subsumed under the newly named entity major neurocognitive dis-
order , although the term dementia  is not precluded from use in the etiological subtypes in
which that term is standard. Furthermore, DSM-5 recognizes a less severe level of cogni-
tive impairment, mild neurocognitive disorder,  which can also be a focus of care, and which
in DSM-IV was subsumed under “Cognitive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.” Diagnos-
tic criteria are provided for both these synd romic entities, followed by diagnostic criteria
for the different etiological subtypes. Several of the NCDs frequently coexist with one an-
other, and their relationships may be multip ly characterized under different chapter sub-
headings, including “Differential Diagnosis” (e.g., NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease vs",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,636
"vascular NCD), “Risk and Prognostic Factors”  (e.g., vascular path ology increasing the
clinical expression of Alzheimer’s disease), and/or “Comorbidity” (e.g., mixed Alzhei-
mer’s disease–vascular pathology). 
The term dementia  is retained in DSM-5 for contin uity and may be used in settings
where physicians and patients are accustomed to this term. Although dementia is the cus-
tomary term for disorders like the degenerative  dementias that usually affect older adults,
the term neurocognitive disorder  is widely used and often preferred for conditions affect-
ing younger individuals, such as impairment secondary to traumatic brain injury or HIV
infection. Furthermore, the major NCD definition is some what broader than the term
dementia,  in that individuals with substantial decline in a single domain can receive this di-
agnosis, most notably the DSM-IV category of “Amnestic Disorder,” which would now be
diagnosed as major NCD due to another medical condition and for which the term demen-
tia would not be used.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,636

is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexa-
methasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a sub-
stance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown,
the category “unknown substance” should be used",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,643
"The name of the disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed by

Regarding course, in hospital settings, delirium usually lasts about 1 week, but some
symptoms often persist even after indivi duals are discharged from the hospital. 
Individuals with delirium may rapidly switch between hyperactive and hypoactive
states. The hyperactive state may be more common or more frequently recognized and
often is associated with medication side effe cts and drug withdrawal . The hypoactive state
may be more frequent in older adults",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,644
"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of deliriu m is a disturbance of attention or awareness that is accom-
panied by a change in baseline cognition that  cannot be better explained by a preexisting
or evolving neurocognitive disorder (NCD). The disturbance in attention (Criterion A) is
manifested by reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention. Questions must
be repeated because the individual’s attentio n wanders, or the individual may perseverate
with an answer to a previous question rather  than appropriately shift attention. The indi-
vidual is easily distracted by irrelevant st imuli. The disturbance in awareness is mani-
fested by a reduced orientation to the environment or at times even to oneself",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,644
"The disturbance develops over a short period  of time, usually hours to a few days, and
tends to fluctuate during the course of the day, often with worsen ing in the evening and
night when external orienting stimuli decrease  (Criterion B). There is evidence from the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a physiologi-
cal consequence of an underlying medical condition, substance intoxication or with-
drawal, use of a medication, or a toxin ex posure, or a combinat ion of these factors
(Criterion E). The etiology should be coded a ccording to the etiologically appropriate sub-
type (i.e., substance or medication intoxica tion, substance withdr awal, another medical",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,644

condition, or multiple etiologi es). Delirium often occurs in  the context of an underlying
NCD. The impaired brain function of individuals with mild and major NCD renders them
more vulnerable to delirium",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,645
"There is an accompanying change in at le ast one other area that may include memory
and learning (particularly recent memory), diso rientation (particularly to time and place),
alteration in language, or perceptual distorti on or a perceptual-motor disturbance (Crite-
rion C). The perceptual dist urbances accompanying delirium include misinterpretations,
illusions, or hallucinations; these disturbances are typically visual, but may occur in other
modalities as well, and range from simple an d uniform to highly complex. Normal atten-
tion/arousal, delirium, and coma lie on a cont inuum, with coma defined as the lack of any
response to verbal stimuli. The ability to evaluate cognition to diagnose delirium depends
on there being a level of arousal sufficient for response to verbal stim ulation; hence, delir-
ium should not be diagnosed in the context of coma (Criterion D). Many noncomatose pa-
tients have a reduced level of arousal. Those patients who show only minimal responses to
verbal stimulation are incapable of engaging with attempts at standardized testing or even
interview. This inability to engage should be  classified as severe inattention. Low-arousal
states (of acute onset) should be recognized as indicating severe inattention and cognitive
change, and hence delirium. They are clinically indistinguishable from delirium diag-
nosed on the basis of inattentio n or cognitive change elicited through cognitive testing and
interview. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Delirium is often associated with a disturbanc e in the sleep-wake cycl e. This disturbance
can include daytime sleepiness, nighttime ag itation, difficulty falling asleep, excessive
sleepiness throughout the day, or wakefulnes s throughout the night.  In some cases, com-
plete reversal of the night-day sleep-wake cy cle can occur. Sleep-wake cycle disturbances
are very common in delirium and have been proposed as a core criterion for the diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,645
"The individual with deliri um may exhibit emotional di sturbances, such as anxiety,
fear, depression, irritability, anger, euphori a, and apathy. There may be rapid and unpre-
dictable shifts from one emot ional state to another. The di sturbed emotional state may also
be evident in calling out, screaming, cursin g, muttering, moaning, or making other
sounds. These behaviors are especially prevalent at nigh t and under conditions in which
stimulation and environmen tal cues are lacking. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of delirium is highest amon g hospitalized older individuals and varies
depending on the individuals’ characteristics, setting of care, and se nsitivity of the detec-
tion method. The prevalence of delirium in the community overall is low (1%–2%) but in-
creases with age, rising to 14% among individuals older than 85 years. The prevalence is
10%–30% in older individuals presenting to emergency departments, where the delirium
often indicates a medical illness. 
The prevalence of delirium when individuals are admitted to the hospital ranges from
14% to 24%, and estimates of the incidence of delirium arising du ring hospitalization
range from 6% to 56% in general hospital populations. Delirium occurs in 15%–53% of
older individuals postoperatively and in 70% –87% of those in intensive care. Delirium oc-
curs in up to 60% of individuals in nursing ho mes or post–acute care settings and in up to
83% of all individuals at the end of life",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,645
"Development and Course
While the majority of individuals with deli rium have a full recovery with or without
treatment, early recognition and intervention usually shortens the duration of the delir-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,645
"Delirium 601
ium. Delirium may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, or death, particularly if the under-
lying cause remains untreated. Mortality amon g hospitalized individuals with delirium is
high, and as many as 40% of individuals with  delirium, particularly those with malignan-
cies and other significant underlying medical illness, die within a year after diagnosis. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Environmental. Delirium may be increased in the cont ext of functional impairment, im-
mobility, a history of falls, low levels of activity, and use of drugs and medications with
psychoactive properties (particularly alcohol and anticholinergics)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,646
"Genetic and physiological. Both major and mild NCDs can increase the risk for delir-
ium and complicate the course. Older individu als are especially susceptible to delirium
compared with younger adults. Susceptibilit y to delirium in infancy and through child-
hood may be greater than in early and mi ddle adulthood. In ch ildhood, delirium may be
related to febrile illnesses and certain medications (e.g., anticholinergics)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,646
"Diagnostic Markers
In addition to laboratory find ings characteristic of underlying medical conditions (or in-
toxication or withdrawal states), there is often generalized slowing on electroencephalog-
raphy, and fast activity is oc casionally found (e.g., in some cases of alcohol withdrawal
delirium). However, electroence phalography is insufficiently sensitive and specific for di-
agnostic use",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,646
"Functional Consequences of Delirium 
Delirium itself is associated with increased functional decline and risk of institutional
placement. Hospitalized individuals 65 years or older with delirium have three times the
risk of nursing home placemen t and about three times the func tional decline as hospital-
ized patients without delirium at both discharge and 3 months postdischarge.

"Subtypes
Major and mild neurocognitive disorders (NCD s) are primarily subtyped according to the
known or presumed etiological/pa thological entity or entities  underlying the cognitive de-
cline. These subtypes are distin guished on the basis of a combin ation of time course, charac-
teristic domains affected, and associated sy mptoms. For certain etio logical subtypes, the
diagnosis depends substantially on the presence of a potentially causative entity, such as Par-
kinson’s or Huntington’s disease, or a traumati c brain injury or stroke in the appropriate time
period. For other etiological subt ypes (generally the neurodegenerative diseases like Alzhei-
mer’s disease, frontotemporal lobar degenerati on, and Lewy body disease), the diagnosis is
based primarily on the cognitive, behavioral, an d functional symptoms. Typically, the differ-
entiation among these syndromes that lack an independently recognized etiological entity is
clearer at the level of major NCD than at the level of mild NCD, but sometimes characteristic
symptoms and associated features are present at the mild level as well. 
NCDs are frequently managed by clinicians  in multiple disciplines. For many sub-
types, multidisciplinary international expert groups have developed specialized consen-
sus criteria based on clinicopathological corr elation with underlying brain pathology. The
subtype criteria here have been harm onized with those expert criteria",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,651
"Specifiers
Evidence for distinct be havioral features in NCDs has been recognized, particularly in the
areas of psychotic symptoms and depression . Psychotic features are common in many
NCDs, particularly at the mild-to-moderate stage of major NCDs due to Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, Lewy body disease, an d frontotemporal lobar degene ration. Paranoia and other
delusions are common features, and often a persecutory theme may be a prominent aspect
of delusional ideation. In contrast to psychotic disorders with onset in earlier life (e.g.,
schizophrenia), disorganized speech and diso rganized behavior are not characteristic of
psychosis in NCDs. Hallucinations may occur in any modality, although visual hallucina-
tions are more common in NCDs than in de pressive, bipolar, or psychotic disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,651
"Mood disturbances, including depression, anxiety, and elat ion, may occur. Depression
is common early in the course (including at the mild NCD level) of NCD due to Alzhei-
mer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, while elation may occur more commonly in fron-
totemporal lobar degeneration. When a full a ffective syndrome meetin g diagnostic criteria
for a depressive or bipolar disorder is pres ent, that diagnosis should be coded as well",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,651
"Mood symptoms are increasingly recognized to be a significant feature in the earliest stages
of mild NCDs such that clinical recogn ition and intervention may be important",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,651
"Agitation is common in a wide variety of NCDs, particularly in major NCD of moder-
ate to severe severity, and often occurs in th e setting of confusion or frustration. It may
arise as combative behaviors, particularly in the context of resisting caregiving duties such
as bathing and dressing. Agitation is characte rized as disruptive motor or vocal activity
and tends to occur with advanced stages of cognitive impairment across all of the NCDs",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,651
"Individuals with NCD can present with a wi de variety of behavioral symptoms that
are the focus of treatment. Sleep disturbance is a common symptom that can create a need
for clinical attention and may include symptoms of insomnia, hypersomnia, and circadian
rhythm disturbances.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,651
"Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders 607
Apathy is common in mild and mild major NCD. It is observed particularly in NCD due
to Alzheimer’s disease and ma y be a prominent feature of NCD due to frontotemporal
lobar degeneration. Apathy is typically char acterized by diminished motivation and re-
duced goal-directed behavior  accompanied by decreased emotional responsiveness",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,652
"Symptoms of apathy may manifest early in the course of NCDs when a loss of motivation
to pursue daily activities or hobbies may be observed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,652
"Other important behavioral symptoms include wandering, disinhibition, hyperpha-
gia, and hoarding. Some of these symptoms are characteristic of specific disorders, as dis-
cussed in the relevant sections. When more th an one behavioral disturbance is observed,
each type should be noted in writing with the specifier “with behavioral symptoms.” 
Diagnostic Features
Major and mild NCDs exist on a spectrum of cognitive and functional impairment. Major
NCD corresponds to the conditio n referred to in DSM-IV as dementia,  retained as an alter-
native in this volume. The co re feature of NCDs is acquir ed cognitive decline in one or
more cognitive domains (Criterion A) based on  both 1) a concern about cognition on the
part of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician, and 2) performance on
an objective assessment that falls below the expected level or that has been observed to de-
cline over time. Both a concer n and objective evidence are re quired because they are com-
plementary. When there is an  exclusive focus on objectiv e testing, a disorder may go
undiagnosed in high-functioning individuals whose currently “normal” performance ac-
tually represents a substantial decline in abilities, or an illness may be incorrectly diag-
nosed in individuals whose currently “low” performance does not represent a change
from their own baseline or is a result of extraneous factors li ke test conditions or a passing
illness. Alternatively, excessive focus on subj ective symptoms may fail to diagnose illness
in individuals with poor insigh t, or whose informants deny or fail to notice their symptoms,
or it may be overly sensitiv e in the so-called worried well",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,652
"A cognitive concern differs from a complaint in that it may or may not be voiced spon-
taneously. Rather, it may need to be elicited  by careful questioning about specific symp-
toms that commonly occur in individuals wi th cognitive deficits (see Table 1 in the
introduction to this chapter). For example, memory concerns include difficulty remember-
ing a short grocery list or keeping track of the plot of a television program; executive con-
cerns include difficulty resuming a task wh en interrupted, organizing tax records, or
planning a holiday meal. At the mild NCD level,  the individual is likely to describe these
tasks as being more difficult or as requiring ex tra time or effort or compensatory strategies",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,652
"At the major NCD level, such tasks may on ly be completed with assistance or may be
abandoned altogether. At the mild NCD level, individuals and their families may not no-
tice such symptoms or may view them as norm al, particularly in the elderly; thus, careful
history taking is of paramount importance. The difficulties must represent changes rather
than lifelong patterns: the individual or info rmant may clarify this i ssue, or the clinician
can infer change from prior experience with the patient or from occupational or other
clues. It is also critical to determine that the difficulties are related to cognitive loss rather
than to motor or sensory limitations. 
Neuropsychological testing,  with performance compared with norms appropriate to
the patient’s age, educational attainment, and cultural background, is part of the standard
evaluation of NCDs and is part icularly critical in the evaluation of mild NCD. For major
NCD, performance is typically 2 or more standard deviations below appropriate norms
(3rd percentile or below). For mild NCD, performance typically lies in the 1–2 standard de-
viation range (between the 3rd and 16th perc entiles). However, neur opsychological test-
ing is not available in all settings, and neuropsychological thresholds are sensitive to the
specific test(s) and norms employed, as well as to test conditions, sensory limitations, and
intercurrent illness. A variety of brief office-based or “bedside” asse ssments, as described",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,652
"608 Neurocognitive Disorders
in Table 1, can also supply objective data in settings where such testing is unavailable or
infeasible. In any case, as with cognitive co ncerns, objective perfor mance must be inter-
preted in light of the individual’s prior pe rformance. Optimally, this information would
be available from a prior administration of the same test, but often it must be inferred
based on appropriate norms, along with the individual’s educational history, occupation,
and other factors. Norms are more challenging to interpret in individuals with very high
or very low levels of education and in indivi duals being tested outside their own language
or cultural background. 
Criterion B relates to the individual’s leve l of independence in everyday functioning",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,653
"Individuals with major NCD will have impairment  of sufficient severity so as to interfere
with independence, such that others will have to take over tasks that the individuals were
previously able to complete on their own. Individuals with mild NCD will have preserved
independence, although there may be subtle in terference with function or a report that
tasks require more effort or take more time than previously. 
The distinction between major and mild NCD is inherently arbitrary, and the disorders
exist along a continuum. Precis e thresholds are therefore difficult to determine. Careful
history taking, observation, and integration wi th other findings are required, and the im-
plications of diagnosis should be considered when an individual’s clinical manifestations
lie at a boundary",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,653
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Typically the associated features that suppo rt a diagnosis of major or mild NCD will be
specific to the etiological subtype (e.g., neur oleptic sensitivity and visual hallucinations in
NCD due to Lewy body disease). Diagnostic features specific to each of the subtypes are
found in the relevant sections",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,653
"Prevalence
The prevalence of NCD varies widely by ag e and by etiological su btype. Overall preva-
lence estimates are generally only availabl e for older population s. Among individuals
older than 60 years, prevalence increases steep ly with age, so prev alence estimates are
more accurate for narrow age bands than for br oad categories such as “over 65” (where the
mean age can vary greatly with the life expect ancy of the given population). For those eti-
ological subtypes occurring across the lifespa n, prevalence estimates for NCD are likely to
be available, if at all, only  as the fraction of individuals who develop NCD among those
with the relevant condition (e.g., tr aumatic brain injury, HIV infection)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,653
"Overall prevalence estimates for dementia (which is largely congruent with major
NCD) are approximately 1%–2% at age 65 years and as high as 30% by age 85 years. The
prevalence of mild NCD is very sensitive to th e definition of the di sorder, particularly in
community settings, where evaluations are less de tailed. In addition, in contrast with clin-
ical settings, where cognitive concern must be high to seek and locate care, there may be a
less clear decline from baseline functioning. Es timates of the prevalence of mild cognitive
impairment (which is substantially congruent with mild NCD) among older individuals
are fairly variable, ranging from 2% to 10% at age 65 and 5% to 25% by age 85",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,653
"Development and Course 
The course of NCD varies acro ss etiological subtypes, and this variation can be useful in
differential diagnosis. Some subtypes (e.g., those related to traumatic brain injury or
stroke) typically begin at a specific time and (at least after initial symptoms related to in-
flammation or swelling subside) remain stat ic. Others may fluctuate over time (although
if this occurs, the possibility  of delirium superimposed on  NCD should be considered)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,653
"NCDs due to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal
lobar degeneration typically are marked by insidious onset and gradual progression, and",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,653
"Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders 609
the pattern of onset of cognitive deficits and associated features helps to distinguish among
them. 
NCDs with onset in childhood and adolescence may have broad repercussions for so-
cial and intellectual development, and in th is setting intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder) and/or other neurod evelopmental disorders may also be diag-
nosed to capture the full diagnostic picture and ensure the provision of a broad range of
services. In older individuals, NCDs often occu r in the setting of medical illnesses, frailty,
and sensory loss, which complicate the clin ical picture for diagnosis and treatment. 
When cognitive loss occurs in youth to midlife, individuals and families are likely to
seek care. NCDs are typically easiest to identify at younger ages, although in some settings
malingering or other factitious disorders may be a concern. Very late in life, cognitive
symptoms may not cause concern or may go unnoticed. In late life, mild NCD must also be
distinguished from the more mo dest deficits associated with “normal aging,” although a
substantial fraction of what has been ascribe d to normal aging likely represents prodromal
phases of various NCDs. In addition, it beco mes harder to recognize mild NCD with age
because of the increasing prevalence of me dical illness and sensory deficits. It becomes
harder to differentiate among subtypes with ag e because there are multiple potential sources
of neurocognitive decline",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,654
"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Risk factors vary not only by etiological subtype but also by age at onset within etiological
subtypes. Some subtypes are distributed thro ughout the lifespan, whereas others occur
exclusively or primarily in late  life. Even within the NCDs of aging, the relative prevalence
varies with age: Alzheimer’s disease is unco mmon before age 60 years, and the prevalence
increases steeply thereafter, while the overa ll less common frontotemporal lobar degener-
ation has earlier onset and represents a progre ssively smaller fraction of NCDs with age. 
Genetic and physiological. The strongest risk factor for major and mild NCDs is age,
primarily because age increases the risk of  neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular dis-
ease. Female gender is associat ed with higher prevalence of dementia overall, and especially
Alzheimer’s disease, but this difference is larg ely, if not wholly, attr ibutable to greater lon-
gevity in females. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Individuals’ and families’ level of awareness and concern about neurocognitive symp-
toms may vary across ethnic and occupational groups. Neurocognitive symptoms are
more likely to be noticed, particularly at the mild level, in individuals who engage in com-
plex occupational, domestic, or recreational activities. In addition , norms for neuropsy-
chological testing tend to be available only for broad populations, and thus they may not
be easily applicable to individuals with less  than high school ed ucation or those being
evaluated outside their primary language or culture. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Like age, culture, and occupa tion, gender issues may affect the level of concern and aware-
ness of cognitive symptoms. In addition, for la te-life NCDs, females are likely to be older,
to have more medical comorbidity, and to liv e alone, which can complicate evaluation and
treatment. In addition, there are gender differ ences in the frequency of some of the etio-
logical subtypes",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,654

logical testing, which will provide a quantitative assessment of all relevant domains and
thus help with diagnosis; provide guidance to the family on areas where the individual
may require more support; and serve as a be nchmark for further decline or response to
therapies. When such testing is  unavailable or not feasible, the brief assessments in Table 1
can provide insight into each domain. More glob al brief mental status tests may be helpful
but may be insensitive, particul arly to modest changes in a single domain or in those with
high premorbid abilities, and may be overly sensitive in those with low premorbid abilities",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,655
"In distinguishing among etiological subtypes, additional diagnostic markers may
come into play, particularly neuroimaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging
scans and positron emission tomography scans. In addition, specific markers may be in-
volved in the assessment of specific subtypes  and may become more important as addi-
tional research findings accumulate over time, as discussed in the relevant sections. 
Functional Consequences of 
Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders 
By definition, major and mild NCDs affect func tioning, given the central role of cognition in
human life. Thus, the criteria for the disorder s, and the threshold for differentiating mild
from major NCD, are based in part on functi onal assessment. Within major NCD there is a
broad range of functional impairment, as implem ented in the severity specifiers. In addition,
the specific functions that are compromised can help identify the cognitive domains affected,
particularly when neuropsychological testing is  not available or is difficult to interpret. 
Differential Diagnosis
Normal cognition. The differential diagnosis between  normal cognition and mild NCD,
as between mild and major NCD, is challenging because the boundaries are inherently ar-
bitrary. Careful history taking and objective as sessment are critical to  these distinctions. A
longitudinal evaluation using quantified a ssessments may be key in detecting mild NCD",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,655
"Delirium. Both mild and major NCD may be difficult to distinguish from a persistent de-
lirium, which can co-occur. Careful assessment  of attention and arou sal will help to make
the distinction",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,655
"Major depressive disorder. The distinction between mild NCD and major depressive
disorder, which may co-occur with NCD, can also be challenging. Specific patterns of cog-
nitive deficits may be helpfu l. For example, consistent memory and executive function
deficits are typical of Alzheimer’s disease, whereas nonspecific or more variable perfor-
mance is seen in major depression. Alternat ively, treatment of the depressive disorder
with repeated observation over time may be required to make the diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,655
"Specific learning disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders. A careful clari-
fication of the individual’s baseline status will help distinguish an NCD from a specific
learning disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders.  Additional issues may enter the
differential for specific etiological subtypes, as described in the relevant sections",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,655
"Comorbidity 
NCDs are common in older individuals and thus  often co-occur with a wide variety of age-
related diseases that may co mplicate diagnosis or treatme nt. Most notable of these is
delirium, for which NCD increases the risk. In  older individuals, a delirium during hos-
pitalization is, in many cases, the first time that an NCD is noticed, although a careful his-
tory will often reveal evidence  of earlier decline. Mixed NC Ds are also common in older
individuals, as many etiological entities incre ase in prevalence with age. In younger indi-

Diagnostic Features 
Beyond the neurocognitive disorder (NCD) syndro me (Criterion A), the core features of ma-
jor or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease include an insidious onset and gradual pro-
gression of cognitive and beha vioral symptoms (Criterion B) . The typical presentation is
amnestic (i.e., with impairment in memory  and learning). Unusual nonamnestic presen-
tations, particularly visuospa tial and logopenic aphasic vari ants, also exist. At the mild
NCD phase, Alzheimer’s disease manifests typically with impairment in memory and learn-
ing, sometimes accompanied by deficits in executive function. At the major NCD phase,
visuoconstructional/perceptual -motor ability and language w ill also be impaired, partic-
ularly when the NCD is moderate to severe. Social cognition tends to be preserved until
late in the course of the disease. 
A level of diagnostic certainty must be sp ecified denoting Alzheimer’s disease as the
“probable” or “possible” etiology (Criterion C). Probable Alzheimer’s disease  is diagnosed in
both major and mild NCD if there is evidence  of a causative Alzheimer’s disease gene, ei-
ther from genetic testing or from an autosomal dominant family history coupled with au-
topsy confirmation or a genetic test in an affected family member. For major NCD, a
typical clinical picture, without extended plat eaus or evidence of mixed etiology, can also
be diagnosed as due to probab le Alzheimer’s disease. For mild NCD, given the lesser de-
gree of certainty that the deficits will prog ress, these features are only sufficient for a
possible  Alzheimer’s etiology. If the etiology appe ars mixed, mild NCD due to multiple eti-
ologies should be diagnosed. In any case, for both mild and major NCD due to Alzhei-
mer’s disease, the clinical features must no t suggest another primary etiology for the NCD
(Criterion D). 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
In specialty clinical settings, approximately 80% of individuals with major NCD due to
Alzheimer’s disease have behavioral and psyc hological manifestations; these features are
also frequent at the mild NCD stage of impa irment. These symptoms are as or more dis-
tressing than cognitive manifestations and ar e frequently the reason that health care is
sought. At the mild NCD stage or the mildest level of majo r NCD, depression and/or ap-
athy are often seen. With moderately severe major NCD, psychotic fe atures, irritability,
agitation, combativeness, and wandering are common. Late in the illness, gait distur-
bance, dysphagia, incontinence, myoc lonus, and seizures are observed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,657
"Prevalence
The prevalence of overall deme ntia (major NCD) rises steeply with age. In high-income
countries, it ranges from 5% to 10% in the seventh decade to  at least 25% thereafter. U.S",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,657
"census data estimates suggest that approxim ately 7% of individuals diagnosed with Alz-
heimer’s disease are between ages 65 and 74 years, 53% are between ages 75 and 84 years,
and 40% are 85 years and older. The percentage  of dementias attributable to Alzheimer’s
disease ranges from about 60% to over 90%, depending on the setting and diagnostic cri-
teria. Mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease is likely to represent a substantial fraction of
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,657

brief plateaus, through severe dementia to death. The mean duration of survival after di-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,657
"Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease 613
agnosis is approximately 10 years, reflecting th e advanced age of the majority of individ-
uals rather than the course of the disease; some individuals can live with the disease for as
long as 20 years. Late-stage individuals are eventually mute and bedbound. Death most
commonly results from aspiration in those who survive through the full course. In mild
NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease, impairments increase over time, and functional status
gradually declines until symptoms reach the threshold for the diagnosis of major NCD. 
The onset of symptoms is usually in the eighth and ninth decades; early-onset forms
seen in the fifth and sixth decades are often related to known causative mutations. Symp-
toms and pathology do not differ markedly at different onset ages. However, younger in-
dividuals are more likely to survive the full course of the disease, while older individuals
are more likely to have numerous medical co morbidities that affect the course and man-
agement of the illness. Diagnostic complexity is  higher in older adults because of the in-
creased likelihood of comorbid me dical illness and mixed pathology",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,658
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Environmental. Traumatic brain injury increases risk  for major or mild NCD due to Alz-
heimer’s disease",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,658
"Genetic and physiological. Age is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. The
genetic susceptibility polymorphism apolipoprotein E4 increases risk and decreases age
at onset, particularly in homozygous individu als. There are also extremely rare causative
Alzheimer’s disease genes. Individuals with Down’s syndrome (trisomy 21) develop Alz-
heimer’s disease if they survive to midlife. Multiple vascular risk factors influence risk for
Alzheimer’s disease and may act by increasing  cerebrovascular pathology or also through
direct effects on Alzheimer pathology. 
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Detection of an NCD may be more difficult in  cultural and socioeconomic settings where
memory loss is considered normal in old age, where older adults face fewer cognitive de-
mands in everyday life, or where very low educational levels pose greater challenges to
objective cognitive assessment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,658
"Diagnostic Markers
Cortical atrophy, amyloid-predominant neuritic plaques, and tau-predominant neurofibril-
lary tangles are hallmarks of the pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and may be
confirmed via postmortem histopathological examination. For early-onset cases with auto-
somal dominant inheritance, a mutation in on e of the known causative Alzheimer’s disease
genes—amyloid precursor protein (APP), presen ilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2)—
may be involved, and genetic testing for such mutations is commercially available, at least
for PSEN1. Apolipoprotein E4 cannot serve as a diagnostic marker because it is only a risk
factor and neither necessary nor sufficient for disease occurrence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,658
"Since amyloid beta-42 deposition in the br ain occurs early in the pathophysiological
cascade, amyloid-based diagnostic tests such  as amyloid imaging on brain positron emis-
sion tomography (PET) scans and reduced leve ls of amyloid beta-42 in the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) may have diagnostic value. Signs of neuronal injury, such as hippocampal and
temporoparietal cortical atrophy on a magnetic resonance image scan, temporoparietal
hypometabolism on a fluorodeoxyglucose PET sc an, and evidence for elevated total tau
and phospho-tau levels in CSF,  provide evidence of neuronal  damage but are less specific
for Alzheimer’s disease. At present, these biomarkers are not fully validated, and many
are available only in tertiary care settings. However, some of them, along with novel bio-
markers, will likely move into wider clinical practice in the coming years. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,658

The prominence of memory loss can cause significant difficulties relatively early in the
course. Social cognition (and thus social func tioning) and procedural memory (e.g., danc-
ing, playing musical instruments) may be relatively preserved for extended periods",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,659
"Differential Diagnosis
Other neurocognitive disorders. Major and mild NCDs due to other neurodegenera-
tive processes (e.g., Lewy body disease, fron totemporal lobar degene ration) share the in-
sidious onset and gradual decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease but have distinctive core
features of their own. In major or mild vascular NCD, th ere is typically history of stroke
temporally related to the onset of cognitive impairment, and infarcts or white matter hy-
perintensities are judged sufficient to accoun t for the clinical picture. However, particu-
larly when there is no clear hi story of stepwise decline, ma jor or mild vascular NCD can
share many clinical features with Alzheimer’s disease. 
Other concurrent, active neurological or systemic illness. Other neurological or sys-
temic illness should be considered if there is an appropriate temporal relationship and
severity to account for the clinical picture. At the mild NCD level, it may be difficult to dis-
tinguish an Alzheimer’s disease etiology from that of another medical condition (e.g., thy-
roid disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency). 
Major depressive disorder. Particularly at the mild NCD level, the differential diagnosis
also includes major depression. The presence of depression may be associated with re-
duced daily functioning and poor concentration that may resemble an NCD, but improve-
ment with treatment of depression may be  useful in making the distinction. 
Comorbidity
Most individuals with Alzheimer’s disease are elderly and have multiple medical conditions
that can complicate diagnosis and influence th e clinical course. Major or mild NCD due to
Alzheimer’s disease commonly co-occurs with cerebrovascular disease, which contributes
to the clinical picture. When a comorbid condition contribute s to the NCD in an individual
with Alzheimer’s disease, then NCD due to multiple etiologies should be diagnosed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,659

Diagnostic Features
Major or mild frontotemporal neurocognitive  disorder (NCD) comprises a number of syn-
dromic variants characterized by the progressi ve development of behavioral and personality
change and/or language impairment. The behavioral variant and three language variants (se-
mantic, agrammatic/nonfluent, and logopenic) ex hibit distinct patterns of brain atrophy and
some distinctive neuropathology. The criteria must be met for either the behavioral or the lan-
guage variant to make the diagnosis, but many  individuals present with features of both",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,660
"Individuals with behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD present with
varying degrees of apathy or disinhibition. They may lose interest in socialization, self-
care, and personal responsibilities, or displa y socially inappropriate behaviors. Insight is
usually impaired, and this often delays medical consultation. The first referral is often to a
psychiatrist. Individuals may develop changes in  social style, and in religious and political
beliefs, with repetitive movements, hoarding, changes in ea ting behavior, and hyperoral-
ity. In later stages, loss of sphincter contro l may occur. Cognitive decline is less prominent,
and formal testing may show relatively few deficits in the early stages. Common neuro-
cognitive symptoms are lack of planning and organization, distractib ility, and poor judg-
ment. Deficits in executive function, such  as poor performance on tests of mental",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,660

ory are relatively spared, and perceptual-mot or abilities are almost always preserved in
the early stages. 
Individuals with language-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD present with pri-
mary progressive aphasia with gradual onse t, with three subtypes commonly described:

has distinctive features and corresponding neuropathology",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,661
"“Probable” is distinguished from “possibl e” frontotemporal NCD by the presence of

gions on structural or functional imaging. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Extrapyramidal features may be prominent in  some cases, with an overlap with syn-
dromes such as progressive supranuclear pa lsy and corticobasal dege neration. Features of
motor neuron disease may be present in some  cases (e.g., muscle atrophy, weakness). A
subset of individuals develop visual hallucinations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,661
"Prevalence
Major or mild frontotemporal NCD is a common  cause of early-onset NCD in individuals
younger than 65 years. Population prevalen ce estimates are in th e range of 2–10 per
100,000. Approximately 20%–25% of cases of  frontotemporal NCD occur in individuals
older than 65 years. Frontotemporal NCD accoun ts for about 5% of all cases of dementia in
unselected autopsy series. Prevalence estima tes of behavioral variant and semantic lan-
guage variant are higher among males, and prevalence estimates of nonfluent language
variant are higher among females. 
Development and Course
Individuals with major or m ild frontotemporal NCD commonly present in the sixth de-
cade of life, although the age at onset varies from the third to the ninth decades. The dis-
ease is gradually progressive, with median  survival being 6–11 years after symptom onset
and 3–4 years after diagnosis. Survival is shorter and decline is faster in major or mild fron-
totemporal NCD than in typical Alzheimer’s disease. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. Approximately 40% of individuals with major or mild fron-
totemporal NCD have a family history of early-onset NCD, and approximately 10% show an
autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. A number of genetic factors have been identified,
such as mutations in the gene  encoding the microtubule asso ciated protein tau (MAPT), the
granulin gene (GRN), and the C9ORF72 gene. A number of families with causative muta-
tions have been identified (see the section “D iagnostic Markers” for th is disorder), but many
individuals with known familial transmission do not have a known mutation. The presence
of motor neuron disease is associated  with a more rapi d deterioration. 
Diagnostic Markers
Computed tomography (CT) or structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show
distinct patterns of atrophy. In behavioral-variant major or mild  frontotemporal NCD,
both frontal lobes (especially the medial frontal lobes) and the anterior temporal lobes are
atrophic. In semantic language–variant majo r or mild frontotemporal NCD, the middle,
inferior, and anterior temporal lobes are at rophic bilaterally but asymmetrically, with the",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,661

temporal NCD is associated with predominantly left posterior fr ontal-insular atrophy",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,662
"The logopenic variant of major or mild fron totemporal NCD is associated with predomi-
nantly left posterior perisylvian or parietal atrophy. Functional imaging demonstrates hy-
poperfusion and/or cortical hypometabolism in the corresponding brain regions, which
may be present in the early stages in the abse nce of structural abno rmality. Emerging bio-
markers for Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid amyl oid-beta and tau levels, and
amyloid imaging) may help in the differential  diagnosis, but the dist inction from Alzhei-
mer’s disease can remain difficult (the logopeni c variant is in fact often a manifestation of
Alzheimer’s disease)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,662
"In familial cases of frontotemporal NCD, the identification of genetic mutations may
help confirm the diagnosis. Mutations associated with frontote mporal NCD include
the genes encoding microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and granulin (GRN),
C9ORF72, transactive response DNA-binding  protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43, or TARDBP),
valosin-containing protein (V CP), chromatin modifying protein 2B (CHMP2B), and fused
in sarcoma protein (FUS). 
Functional Consequences of Major or Mild 
Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder
Because of the relative early age at onset of the disorder, the disorder oftens affects work-
place and family life. Because of the involvem ent of language and/or behavior, function is
often more severely impaired relatively early in the course . For individuals with the be-
havioral variant, prior to diagnostic clarific ation there may be significant family disrup-
tion, legal involvement, and problems in the workplace because of socially inappropriate
behaviors. The functional impairment due to  behavioral change and language dysfunc-
tion, which can include hyperorality, impuls ive wandering, and other dishinhibited be-
haviors, may far exceed that due to the co gnitive disturbance and may lead to nursing
home placement or institutionalization. Thes e behaviors can be severely disruptive, even
in structured care settings, particularly wh en the individuals are otherwise healthy, non-
frail, and free of othe r medical comorbidities. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other neurocognitive disorders. Other neurodegenerative diseases may be distinguished
from major or mild frontotemporal NCD by th eir characteristic features. In major or mild

"However, 10%–30% of patients presenting with  a syndrome suggestive of major or mild
frontotemporal NCD are found at  autopsy to have Alzheimer’s disease pathology. This oc-
curs more frequently in individuals who present with progressi ve dysexecutive syn-
dromes in the absence of behavioral changes or movement disorder or in those with the
logopenic variant",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,662
"In major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies, co re and suggestive features of Lewy bodies
must be present. In major or mild NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, spontaneous parkin-
sonism emerges well befo re the cognitive decline. In majo r or mild vascular NCD, depend-
ing on affected brain regions, there may also  be loss of executive ability and behavioral
changes such as apathy, and this disorder should  be considered in the differential diagno-
sis. However, history of a cerebrovascular event is temporally related to the onset of cog-
nitive impairment in major or mild vascular NCD, and neuroimaging reveals infarctions
or white matter lesions sufficient to account for the clinical picture. 
Other neurological conditions. Major or mild frontotemporal NCD overlaps with pro-
gressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal  degeneration, and motor neuron disease
clinically as well as pathologically. Progressive supranuclear palsy is characterized by",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,662

supranuclear gaze palsies and axial-predominant parkinsoni sm. Pseudobulbar signs may
be present, and retropulsion is often prom inent. Neurocognitive assessment shows psy-
chomotor slowing, poor working memory, and executive dysfunction. Corticobasal degen-
eration presents with asymmetr ic rigidity, limb apraxia, postural instability, myoclonus,
alien limb phenomenon, and cortical sensory loss. Many individuals wi th behavioral-variant
major or mild frontotemporal NCD show features of motor neuron disease, which tend to
be mixed upper and predominantly lower motor neuron disease. 
Other mental disorders and medical conditions. Behavioral-variant major or mild fron-
totemporal NCD may be mistaken for a primary mental disorder, such as major depression,
bipolar disorders, or schizophrenia, and individuals with this variant often present initially

help to make the distinction. A careful medi cal evaluation will help to exclude treatable

Diagnostic Features
Major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies (NCDLB), in the case of major
neurocognitive disorder (NCD), corresponds  to the condition known as dementia with
Lewy bodies (DLB). The disorder includes  not only progressive cognitive impairment
(with early changes in complex attention and ex ecutive function rather than learning and
memory) but also recurrent complex visual hallucinations; and concurrent symptoms of
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior diso rder (which can be a very early manifes-
tation); as well as hallucinations in other sensory modalities, depression, and delusions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,664
"The symptoms fluctuate in a pattern that can resemble a delirium, but no adequate under-
lying cause can be found. The variable pres entation of NCDLB symptoms reduces the like-
lihood of all symptoms being observed in a brief clinic visit and necessitates a thorough
assessment of caregive r observations. The use of assessment scales specifically designed to
assess fluctuation may aid in diagnosis. Anot her core feature is spontaneous parkinson-
ism, which must begin after the onset of cognit ive decline; by convention, major cognitive
deficits are observed at least 1 year befo re the motor symptoms. The parkinsonism must
also be distinguished from neuroleptic-induce d extrapyramidal signs.  Accurate diagnosis
is essential to safe treatment planning, as up  to 50% of individuals with NCDLB have se-
vere sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs, and these medications should be used with extreme
caution in managing the psychotic manifestations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,664
"The diagnosis of mild NCDLB is appropriate for individuals who present with the core
or suggestive features at a stage when cognitive or functional impairments are not of suf-
ficient severity to fulfill criteria for major NC D. However, as for all mild NCDs, there will
often be insufficient ev idence to justify any si ngle etiology, and use of the unspecified di-
agnosis is most appropriate",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,664
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with NCDLB frequently experience  repeated falls and syncope and transient
episodes of unexplained loss of consciousness. Autonomic dysfunction, such as ortho-
static hypotension and urinary incontinen ce, may be observed. Auditory and other
nonvisual hallucinations are common, as are sy stematized delusions, delusional misiden-
tification, and depression",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,664
"Prevalence
The few population-based prev alence estimates for NCDLB available range from 0.1% to
5% of the general elderly popu lation, and from 1.7% to 30.5 % of all dementia cases. In
brain bank (autopsy) series, the pathological lesions known as Lewy bodies are present in
20%–35% of cases of dementia. The male-to- female ratio is approximately 1.5:1. 
Development and Course 
NCDLB is a gradually progressive disorder with  insidious onset. However, there is often
a prodromal history of confusional episodes (delirium) of acute onset, often precipitated
by illness or surgery. The distinction between NCDLB, in which Lewy bodies are primar-
ily cortical in location, and major or mild NC D due to Parkinson’s disease, in which the pa-
thology is primarily in the basal ganglia, is  the order in which th e cognitive and motor
symptoms emerge. In NCDLB, th e cognitive decline is manifest ed early in the course of ill-
ness, at least a year before the onset of mo tor symptoms (see the section “Differential Di-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,664
"620 Neurocognitive Disorders
agnosis” for this disorder). Disease course may be characterized by occasional plateaus
but eventually progresses through severe deme ntia to death. Average duration of survival
is 5–7 years in clinical series. Onset of symptoms is typically observed from the sixth
through the ninth decades of life, with most cases having their onset when affected indi-
viduals are in their mid-70s",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,665
"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Genetic and physiological. Familial aggregation may occur, and several risk genes have
been identified, but in most cases of NCDLB, there is no family history",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,665
"Diagnostic Markers
The underlying neurodegenerative disease is  primarily a synucleinopathy due to alpha-
synuclein misfolding and aggregation. Cognitiv e testing beyond the use of a brief screen-
ing instrument may be necessary to define de ficits clearly. Assessment scales developed to
measure fluctuation can be useful. The associated condition REM sl eep behavior disorder
may be diagnosed through a formal sleep study or identified by questioning the patient or
informant about relevant symptoms. Neurolep tic sensitivity (challenge) is not recom-
mended as a diagnostic marker but raises suspicion of NCDLB if it occurs. A diagnosti-
cally suggestive feature is low striatal dopa mine transporter uptake on single photon
emission computed tomography  (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) scan",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,665
"Other clinically useful markers potentially include relative preservation of medial tempo-
ral structures on computed tomography (C T)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain
scan; reduced striatal dopamine transporter uptake on SPECT/PET scan; generalized low
uptake on SPECT/PET perfusion scan with re duced occipital activity; abnormal (low up-
take) MIBG myocardial scintigraphy suggest ing sympathetic denervation; and prominent
slow-wave activity on the electroencephalo gram with temporal lobe transient waves",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,665
"Functional Consequences of Major or Mild 
Neurocognitive Disord er With Lewy Bodies
Individuals with NCDLB are more  functionally impaired than would be expected for their
cognitive deficits when contrasted to individuals with other neurodegenerative diseases,
such as Alzheimer’s disease. This is largely a result of motor and autonomic impairments,
which cause problems with toileting, transfer ring, and eating. Sleep disorders and prom-
inent psychiatric symptoms may also add to functional di fficulties. Consequently, the qual-
ity of life of individuals with NCDLB is often significantly worse than that of individuals
with Alzheimer’s disease",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,665
"Differential Diagnosis 
Major or mild neurocognitive diso rder due to Parkinson’s disease. A key differenti-
ating feature in clinical diagnosis is the tempor al sequence in which the parkinsonism and
the NCD appear. For NCD due to Parkinson’s disease, the individual must develop cog-
nitive decline in the context of established Parkinson’s disease; by convention, the decline
should not reach the stage of major NCD until at least 1 year after Parkinson’s is diagnosed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,665
"If less than a year has passed since the onset of motor symptoms, the diagnosis is NCDLB",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,665
"This distinction is clearer at the major NCD level than at the mild NCD level. 
The timing and sequence of parkinsonism an d mild NCD may be more difficult to de-
termine because the onset and clinical presentation can be ambiguous, and unspecified
mild NCD should be diagnosed if the othe r core and suggestive features are absent.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,665
"Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder 621
Comorbidity 
Lewy body pathology frequent ly coexists with Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular
disease pathology, particularly among the olde st age groups. In Alzheimer’s disease, there
is concomitant synuclein pathology in 60% of cases (if amygdala-restricted cases are in-
cluded). In general, there is a higher rate of Lewy body pathology in individuals with de-
mentia than in older individuals without dementia.

The diagnosis of major or mild  vascular neurocognitive diso rder (NCD) requires the es-
tablishment of an NCD (Criterion A) and the determination that cere brovascular disease is
the dominant if not exclusive pathology that accounts for the cognitive deficits (Criteria B
and C). Vascular etiology may range from large vessel stroke to micr ovascular disease; the",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,666

presentation is therefore very heterogeneous, stemming from the types of vascular lesions
and their extent and location. The lesions may be focal, multifocal, or diffuse and occur in
various combinations. 
Many individuals with major or mild vascul ar NCD present with multiple infarctions,
with an acute stepwise or fluctuating dec line in cognition, and intervening periods of
stability and even some improvement. Others may have gradual onset with slow pro-
gression, a rapid development of deficits follo wed by relative stabilit y, or another complex
presentation. Major or mild vascular NCD wi th a gradual onset an d slow progression is
generally due to small vessel disease leading to lesions in the white matter, basal ganglia,
and/or thalamus. The gradual progression in these cases is often punctuated by acute
events that leave subtle neurological deficits. The cognitive deficits in these cases can be at-
tributed to disruption of cortical-subcortical  circuits, and complex attention, particularly
speed of information processing, and exec utive ability are likely to be affected",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,667
"Assessing for the presence of sufficient cerebrovascular disease relies on history, phys-
ical examination, and neuroimaging (Criterion  C). Etiological certainty requires the dem-
onstration of abnormalities on neuroimaging. The lack of neuroimaging can result in
significant diagnostic inaccuracy by overlooking “silent” brain infarction and white mat-
ter lesions. However, if the neurocognitive im pairment is temporally associated with one
or more well-documented  strokes, a probable diagnosis can be made in the absence of neu-
roimaging. Clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disease includes documented history of
stroke, with cognitive decline temporally assoc iated with the event, or physical signs con-
sistent with stroke (e.g., hemi paresis; pseudobulbar syndrome , visual field defect). Neuro-
imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT]) evidence of
cerebrovascular disease comprises one or more of the following: one or more large vessel
infarcts or hemorrhages, a strategically placed  single infarct or hemorrhage (e.g., in angu-
lar gyrus, thalamus, basal forebrain), two or mo re lacunar infarcts outside the brain stem,
or extensive and confluent white matter lesions. The latter is often termed small vessel dis-
ease or subcortical ischemic changes  on clinical neuroimaging evaluations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,667

"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
A neurological assessmen t often reveals history of stroke  and/or transient ischemic epi-
sodes, and signs indicative of brain infarctions. Also commonly associated are personality
and mood changes, abulia, depression, and emotional lability. The development of late-

Functional Consequences of 
Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder
Major or mild vascular NCD is commonly asso ciated with physical deficits that cause ad-
ditional disability. 
Differential Diagnosis 
Other neurocognitive disorders. Since incidental brain infarctions and white matter le-
sions are common in older individuals, it is important to consider other possible etiologies
when an NCD is present. A history of memory  deficit early in the course, and progressive
worsening of memory, language, executive function, and perceptual-motor abilities in the
absence of corresponding focal lesions on br ain imaging, are suggestive of Alzheimer’s
disease as the primary diagnosis. Potential bi omarkers currently being validated for Alz-
heimer’s disease, such as cerebrospinal fluid levels of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated
tau, and amyloid imaging, may prove to be helpful in the differential diagnosis. NCD with
Lewy bodies is distinguished fr om major or mild vascular NCD by its core features of fluc-
tuating cognition, visual hallu cinations, and spontaneous parkinsonism. While deficits in
executive function and language occur in majo r or mild vascular NC D, the insidious onset
and gradual progression of behavioral features or language impairment are characteristic
of frontotemporal NCD and are no t typical of vascular etiology",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,668

ders) are present and are of su fficient severity to account for the cognitive impairment.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,668
"624 Neurocognitive Disorders
Other mental disorders. A diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is inappropriate if
the symptoms can be entirely attributed to  delirium, although delirium may sometimes be
superimposed on a preexisting major or mild vascular NCD, in which case both diagnoses
can be made. If the criteria for major depressive disorder are met and the cognitive impair-
ment is temporally related to the likely onse t of the depression, major or mild vascular
NCD should not be diagnosed. However, if the NCD preceded the development of the de-
pression, or the severity of the cognitive impairment is out of proportion to the severity of
the depression, both should be diagnosed.

"Diagnostic Features
Major or mild NCD due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by an impact to the head,
or other mechanisms of rapid movement or di splacement of the brain within the skull, as
can happen with blast injuries. Traumatic brain injury  is defined as brain trauma with spe-
cific characteristics that include at least one of the following: loss of consciousness, post-
traumatic amnesia, diso rientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological
signs (e.g., positive neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked worsening of a pre-
existing seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia, hemiparesi s) (Criterion B). To be at-
tributable to TBI, the NCD must  present either immediately after the brain injury occurs or
immediately after the individu al recovers consciousness afte r the injury and persist past
the acute post-injury period (Criterion C). 
The cognitive presentation is variable. Difficulties in the domains of complex attention,
executive ability, learning, an d memory are common as well as slowing in speed of infor-
mation processing and disturbances in social cognition. In more seve re TBI in which there
is brain contusion, intracranial hemorrhage, or  penetrating injury, there may be additional

Neurobehavioral symptoms tend to be most severe in the immediate aftermath of the
TBI. Except in the case of severe TBI, the typi cal course is that of complete or substantial
improvement in associated neurocognitive, neurological, and psyc hiatric symptoms and

weeks after the injury with complete resoluti on typical by 3 months. Other symptoms that
may potentially co-occur with the neurological  symptoms (e.g., depression, irritability,
fatigue, headache, photosensitivity, sleep dist urbance) also tend to resolve in the weeks
following mild TBI. Substantial subsequent deterioration in these areas should trigger con-

Functional Consequences of Major or Mild 
Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury 
With mild NCD due to TBI, individuals may re port reduced cognitive efficiency, difficulty
concentrating, and lessened abilit y to perform usual activities. With major NCD due to TBI, an
individual may have di fficulty in independent living an d self-care. Prominent neuromotor
features, such as severe incoordination, ataxia , and motor slowing, may be present in major
NCD due to TBI and may add to functional diffi culties. Individuals with TBI histories report
more depressive symptoms, and these can amp lify cognitive complaints and worsen func-
tional outcome. Additionally, loss of emotional control, including aggre ssive or inappropriate
affect and apathy, may be present after more se vere TBI with greater neurocognitive impair-
ment. These features may compound difficulti es with independent living and self-care",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,672
"Differential Diagnosis
In some instances, severity of neurocognitive symptoms ma y appear to be inconsistent
with the severity of the TBI. After previously  undetected neurologic al complications (e.g.,
chronic hematoma) are excluded , the possibility of diagnoses such as somatic symptom
disorder or factitious disorder need to be considered. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
can co-occur with the NCD and have overlappi ng symptoms (e.g., difficulty concentrat-
ing, depressed mood, aggressiv e behavioral disinhibition)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,672
"Comorbidity
Among individuals with substa nce use disorders, the neurocognitive effects of the sub-
stance contribute to or compound the TBI-as sociated neurocognitive change. Some symp-
toms associated with TBI may overlap with sy mptoms found in cases of PTSD, and the two
disorders may co-occur, especia lly in military populations.

for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the sub-
stance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician
should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced neurocognitive
disorder (e.g., “mild inhalant use disorder wi th inhalant-induced major neurocognitive disor-

induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should
record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending
on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance
use disorder, then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the

brain imaging indicators may be seen over ma ny months. If the diso rder continues for an
extended period, persistent  should be specified. The give n substance and its use must be
known to be capable of causing the observed impairments (Criterion C). While nonspecific
decrements in a range of cognitive abilities can occur with nearly any substance of abuse
and a variety of medications, some patterns occur more frequently  with selected drug
classes. For example, NCD due to sedative, hypno tic, or anxiolytic drugs (e.g., benzodiaz-
epines, barbiturates) ma y show greater disturbances in memory than in other cognitive
functions. NCD induced by alcohol frequently  manifests with a co mbination of impair-
ments in executive-function and memory and learning domains. Th e temporal course of
the substance-induced NCD must be consistent  with that of use of the given substance
(Criterion D). In alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory (Korsakoff ’s) NCD, the features
include prominent amnesia (severe difficulty learning new information with rapid forget-
ting) and a tendency to confabulate. These ma nifestations may co-occur with signs of thi-
amine encephalopathy (Wernicke’s encephalopathy) with associated features such as
nystagmus and ataxia. Ophthalmoplegia of Wernicke’s encephalopathy is typically charac-
terized by a lateral gaze paralysis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,675
"In addition to or independent of the mo re common neurocognitive symptoms related
to methamphetamine use (e.g., difficulties wi th learning and memory; executive func-
tion), methamphetamine use can also be associat ed with evidence of vascular injury (e.g.,
focal weakness, unilateral incoordination, as ymmetrical reflexes). The most common neu-
rocognitive profile approximates that seen in vascular NCD. 
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Intermediate-duration NC D induced by drugs with central nervous system depressant effects
may manifest with added symptoms of increased irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and
dysphoria. Intermediate-duration NCD induced by stimulant drugs may manifest with re-
bound depression, hypersomnia, and apathy. In severe forms of substance/medication-
induced major NCD (e.g., associ ated with long-term alcohol use), there may be prominent
neuromotor features, such as incoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing. There may also be
loss of emotional control, including aggres sive or inappropriat e affect, or apathy",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,675
"Prevalence
The prevalence of these conditions is not know n. Prevalence figures for substance abuse are
available, and substance/medica tion-induced major or mild NCDs are more likely in those
who are older, have longer use, and have other risk factors such as nutritional deficits",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,675
"For alcohol abuse, the rate of mild NCD of intermediate duration is approximately 30%–
40% in the first 2 months of abstinence. Mild NCD may persist, particularly in those who do
not achieve stable abstinence until after age 50 years. Major NCD is rare and may result from
concomitant nutritional deficits, as in al cohol-induced amnestic  confabulatory NCD",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,675
"For individuals quitting cocaine, metham phetamine, opioids, phencyclidine, and sed-
ative, hypnotics, or anxiolytics, substance/medication-induced mild NCD of intermediate
duration may occur in one-third or more, and there is some evidence that these substances
may also be associated with persistent mild  NCD. Major NCD associated with these sub-
stances is rare, if it occurs at  all. In the case of methamph etamine, cerebr ovascular disease
can also occur, resulting in diffuse or focal brain injury that  can be of mild or major neu-
rocognitive levels. Solvent expo sure has been linked to both major and mild NCD of both
intermediate and persistent duration.

"Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder 631
Development and Course
Substance use disorders tend to commence du ring adolescence and peak in the 20s and
30s. Although longer history of severe substa nce use disorder is associated with greater
likelihood of NCD, the relationships are not straightforward, with substantial and even
complete recovery of neurocognitive func tions being common among individuals who
achieve stable abstinence prior to age 50 ye ars. Substance/medication-induced major or
mild NCD is most likely to become persistent in individuals who continue abuse of sub-
stances past age 50 years, presumably becaus e of a combination of lessened neural plas-
ticity and beginnings of other age-related br ain changes. Earlier commencement of abuse,
particularly of alcohol, may lead to defects in later neural development (e.g., later stages of
maturation of frontal circuitries), which may have effects on social cognition as well as
other neurocognitive abilities.  For alcohol-induced NCD, there may be an additive effect
of aging and alcohol-induced brain injury",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,676
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Risk factors for substance/medication-induced  NCDs include older age, longer use, and
persistent use past age 50 years. In additi on, for alcohol-induced NCD, long-term nutri-
tional deficiencies, liver disease, vascular r isk factors, and cardiovascular and cerebrovas-
cular disease may contribute to risk. 
Diagnostic Markers
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of individuals with chronic alcohol abuse frequently
reveals cortical thinning, white matter loss, and enlargement of sulci and ventricles. While
neuroimaging abnormalities are more common in  those with NCDs, it is possible to ob-
serve NCDs without neuroimaging abnormalitie s, and vice versa. Specialized techniques
(e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) may reveal damage to specific white matter tracts. Mag-
netic resonance spectroscopy may reveal reduction in N-acetylaspartate, and increase in
markers of inflammation (e.g., myoinositol) or white matter injury (e.g., choline). Many of
these brain imaging changes and neurocogniti ve manifestations reverse following suc-
cessful abstinence. In individuals with meth amphetamine use disorder, MRI may also re-
veal hyperintensities suggestive of microhem orrhages or larger areas of infarction",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,676
"Functional Consequences of Substance/Medication-
Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder
The functional consequences of substance/ medication-induced mild NCD are sometimes
augmented by reduced cognitive efficiency an d difficulty concentrating beyond that seen
in many other NCDs. In addition, at both major and mild levels, substance/medication-
induced NCDs may have associated motor syndro mes that increase the level of functional
impairment. 
Differential Diagnosis
Individuals with substance use disorders, substance intoxica tion, and substance withdrawal
are at increased risk for othe r conditions that may independently, or through a compounding
effect, result in neurocognitive  disturbance. These include hi story of traumatic brain injury
and infections that can accompany substance use disorder (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syph-
ilis). Therefore, presence of substance/medi cation-induced major or mild NCD should be
differentiated from NCDs arising outside the co ntext of substance use, intoxication, and with-

Diagnostic Features 
HIV disease is caused by infection with hu man immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1),
which is acquired through exposure to bodily fluids of an infected person through injection
drug use, unprotected sexual contact, or acci dental or iatrogenic exposure (e.g., contami-
nated blood supply, needle puncture injury to medical personnel). HIV infects several types
of cells, most particularly immune cells. Over time, the infection can cause severe depletion
of “T-helper” (CD4) lymphocytes, resulting in severe immunocompromise, often leading to
opportunistic infections and neoplasms. This  advanced form of HIV infection is termed
acquired immune deficiency syndrome  (AIDS). Diagnosis of HIV is confirmed by established
laboratory methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV antibody with
Western blot confirmation and/or polymera se chain reaction–based assays for HIV. 
Some individuals with HIV infection deve lop an NCD, which generally shows a “sub-
cortical pattern” with prominently impaired executive function, slowing of processing
speed, problems with more demanding attentio nal tasks, and difficulty in learning new
information, but fewer problems with recall of  learned information. In major NCD, slow-
ing may be prominent. Language difficulties , such as aphasia, are uncommon, although
reductions in fluency may be observed. HIV pathogenic proc esses can affect any part of
the brain; therefore, other patterns are possible. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,677
"Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection 633
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Major or mild NCD due to HIV infection is usually more prevalent in individuals with
prior episodes of severe immunosuppression, high viral loads in the cerebrospinal fluid,
and indicators of advanced HIV disease such as anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Individ-
uals with advanced NCD may experience prom inent neuromotor features such as severe
incoordination, ataxia, and moto r slowing. There may be loss of emotional control, includ-
ing aggressive or inappropriate affect or apathy. 
Prevalence
Depending on stage of HIV disease, approx imately one-third to over one-half of HIV-
infected individuals have at least mild neuroc ognitive disturbance, but some of these dis-
turbances may not meet the full criteria for mild NCD. An estimated 25% of individuals
with HIV will have signs and symptoms that meet criteria for mild NCD, and in fewer than
5% would criteria for major NCD be met. 
Development and Course 
An NCD due to HIV infection can resolve, improve, slowly worsen, or have a fluctuating
course. Rapid progression to profound neur ocognitive impairment is uncommon in the
context of currently available combination antiviral treatment; co nsequently, an abrupt
change in mental status in an individual with HIV may prompt an evaluation of other
medical sources for the cognitive change, incl uding secondary infections. Because HIV in-
fection preferentially affects subcortical regi ons over the course of  illness, including deep
white matter, the progression of the disorder follows a “subcortical ” pattern. Since HIV
can affect a variety of brain regions, and the illness can take on many different trajectories
depending on associated comorbidities and cons equences of HIV, the overall course of an
NCD due to HIV infection has considerable heterogeneity. A subc ortical neurocognitive
profile may interact with age over the life course, when psychomo tor slowing and motor
impairments such as slowed gait may occur as a consequence of other age-related condi-
tions so that the overall progression ma y appear more pronounced in later life. 
In developed countries, HIV disease is primar ily a condition of adults, with acquisition
via risky behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, inje ction drug use) beginning in late adolescence
and peaking during young and middle adulth ood. In developing countries, particularly
sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV testing and an tiretroviral treatments for pregnant women
are not readily available, perinatal transmis sion is common. The NCD in such infants and
children may present primarily as neurodevelopment al delay. As individuals treated for
HIV survive into older age, additive and in teractive neurocognitive effects of HIV and
aging, including other NCDs (e .g., due to Alzheimer’s dise ase, due to Parkinson’s dis-
ease), are possible. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Risk and prognostic factors for HIV infection. Risk factors for HIV infection include injec-
tion drug use, unprotected sex, and unprotecte d blood supply and othe r iatrogenic factors. 
Risk and prognostic factors for major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to HIV in-
fection. Paradoxically, NCD due to HIV infection ha s not declined significantly with the
advent of combined antiretrov iral therapy, although the most  severe presentations (con-
sistent with the diagnosis of major NCD) ha ve decreased sharply. Contributory factors
may include inadequate control of HIV in the central nervous system (CNS), the evolution
of drug-resistant viral strains, the effects of  chronic long-term systemic and brain inflam-
mation, and the effects of comorb id factors such as aging, drug  abuse, past history of CNS
trauma, and co-infections, such as with the hepatitis C virus. Chronic exposure to antiret-
roviral drugs also raises the po ssibility of neurotoxicity, alth ough this has not been defin-
itively established. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,678
"634 Neurocognitive Disorders
Diagnostic Markers
Serum HIV testing is required for the diagnosis.  In addition, HIV charac terization of the cere-
brospinal fluid may be helpful if it reveals a disp roportionately high viral load in cerebrospinal
fluid versus in the plasma. Neuroimaging (i.e.,  magnetic resonance im aging [MRI]) may reveal
reduction in total brain volume, cortical thi nning, reduction in white matter volume, and
patchy areas of abnormal white matter (hyper intensities). MRI or lumbar puncture may be
helpful to exclude a specific medical condition such as cryptococcus infection or herpes en-
cephalitis that may contribute to CNS changes in the context of AIDS. Specialized techniques
such as diffusion tensor imaging may reveal  damage to specific white matter tracts. 
Functional Consequences of Major or Mild 
Neurocognitive Disorder  Due to HIV Infection
Functional consequences of ma jor or mild NCD due to HIV infection are variable across
individuals. Thus, impaired executive abiliti es and slowed information processing may
substantially interfere with the complex dise ase management decisions required for ad-
herence to the combined antire troviral therapy regimen. The likelihood of comorbid dis-
ease may further create functional challenges. 
Differential Diagnosis
In the presence of comorbidities, such as other infections (e.g., hepati tis C virus, syphilis),
drug abuse (e.g., methamphetamine abuse), or  prior head injury or neurodevelopmental
conditions, major or mild NCD due to HIV infe ction can be diagnosed provided there is ev-
idence that infection with HIV has worsened any NCDs due to such preexisting or comorbid
conditions. Among older adults, onset of neur ocognitive decline rela ted to cerebrovascular
disease or neurodegeneration (e.g., major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease) may
need to be differentiated. In general, stable, fluctuating (without progression) or improving
neurocognitive status would favor an HIV et iology, whereas steady or stepwise deter-
ioration would suggest neurodeg enerative or vascular etiolo gy. Because more severe im-
munodeficiency can result in opportunistic in fections of the brain (e.g., toxoplasmosis;
cryptococcosis) and neoplasia (e.g., CNS lymphoma), sudden onset of an NCD or sudden
worsening of that disorder demands acti ve investigation of non-HIV etiologies",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,679
"Comorbidity
HIV disease is accompanied by chronic systemic  and neuro-inflammation that can be as-
sociated with cerebrovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. These complications can
be part of the pathogenesis of major or mild NCD due to HIV infectio n. HIV frequently co-
occurs with conditions such as substance use disorders when the substance has been in-
jected and other sexually  transmitted disorders.

Diagnostic Features
The classification of major or mild neurocogni tive disorder (NCD) due to prion disease in-
cludes NCDs due to a group of subacute sp ongiform encephalopathies (including Creutz-
feldt-Jakob disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru, Gerstmann-Sträussler-
Scheinker syndrome, and fatal insomnia) ca used by transmissible agents known as prions",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,680
"The most common type is sporadic Creutzfeld t-Jakob disease, typically referred to as
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Variant CJD is  much rarer and is associated with trans-
mission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy,  also called “mad cow disease.” Typically,
individuals with CJD present with neurocognitive deficits , ataxia, and abnormal move-
ments such as myoclonus, chorea, or dystonia; a startle reflex is also common. Typically,
the history reveals rapid progression to major NCD over as little as 6 months, and thus the
disorder is typically seen only at the major le vel. However, many individuals with the dis-
order may have atypical presentations, and the disease can be confirmed only by biopsy or
at autopsy. Individuals with variant CJD may present with a greater preponderance of
psychiatric symptoms, characterized a by lo w mood, withdrawal, and anxiety. Prion dis-
ease is typically not diagnosed without at le ast one of the characteristic biomarker fea-
tures: recognized lesions on magnetic resonance imaging with DWI (diffusion-weighted
imaging) or FLAIR (flu id-attenuated inversion recovery), tau or 14-3-3 protein in cerebro-
spinal fluid, characteristic triphasic waves on electroencephalogram, or, for rare familial
forms, family history or genetic testing. 
Prevalence
The annual incidence of sporadic CJD is a pproximately one or two cases per million peo-
ple. Prevalence is unknown but ve ry low given the short survival",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,680
"Development and Course
Prion disease may develop at any age in adults—the peak age for the sporadic CJD is ap-
proximately 67 years—although it has been report ed to occur in individuals spanning the
teenage years to late life. Prodromal symptoms  of prion disease may include fatigue, anx-
iety, problems with appetite or sleeping, or difficulties with concentration. After several
weeks, these symptoms may be followed by incoordination, altered vision, or abnormal
gait or other movements that may be myoclonic,  choreoathetoid, or ballistic, along with a
rapidly progressive dementia. The disease typi cally progresses very rapidly to the major
level of impairment over several months. More rarely, it can progress over 2 years and ap-
pear similar in its course to other NCDs.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,680

Risk Factors and Prognosis
Environmental. Cross-species transmission  of prion infections, with agents that are
closely related to the human form, has been demonstrated (e.g., the outbreak of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy inducing variant CJD in the United Kingdom during the mid-
1990s). Transmission by corneal transplantation and by human growth factor injection has
been documented, and anecdotal cases of tran smission to health care workers have been
reported",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,681

ated with an autosoma l dominant mutation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,681
"Diagnostic Markers
Prion disease can be definitively confirmed only by biopsy or at autopsy. Although there are
no distinctive findings on cerebrospinal fluid analysis across the prion diseases, reliable bio-
markers are being developed and include 14-3-3 protein (particularly for sporadic CJD) as
well as tau protein. Magnetic resonance brain imaging is currently considered the most sen-
sitive diagnostic test when DWI is performed, with the most common finding being multi-
focal gray matter hyperintensities in subcortical and cortical regions. In some individuals,
the electroencephalogram reve als periodic sharp, often triphasic and synchronous dis-
charges at a rate of 0.5–2 Hz at some point during the course of the disorder.

Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of major or mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Parkinson’s
disease is cognitive decline following the onset of Parkinson’s disease. The disturbance
must occur in the setting of established Parkinson’s disease (Criterion B), and deficits must
have developed gradually (Criterion C). The NCD is viewed as probably due to Parkinson’s
disease when there is no evidence of another disorder that might be contributing to the
cognitive decline and when the Parkinson’s disease clearly precedes onset of the NCD. The
NCD is considered possibly due to Parkinson’s disease either  when there is no evidence of
another disorder that might be contributing to the cognitive decline or when the Parkin-
son’s disease precedes onset of the NCD, but not both",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,682
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Frequently present features include apathy , depressed mood, anxious mood, hallucina-
tions, delusions, personality changes, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and
excessive daytime sleepiness. 
Prevalence 
The prevalence of Parkinson’s disease in the United States steadily increases with age from
approximately 0.5% between ages 65 and 69 to  3% at age 85 years and older. Parkinson’s
disease is more common in males than in females. Among individuals with Parkinson’s
disease, as many as 75% will develop a major NC D sometime in the course of their disease",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,682
"The prevalence of mild NCD in Parkinso n’s disease has been estimated at 27%. 
Development and Course
Onset of Parkinson’s disease is typically betw een the sixth and ninth decades of life, with
most expression in the early 60s. Mild NCD ofte n develops relatively early in the course of
Parkinson’s disease, whereas major impairme nt typically does not occur until late.

"Differential Diagnosis
Major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies. This distinction is based sub-
stantially on the timing and sequence of mo tor and cognitive symptoms. For NCD to be at-
tributed to Parkinson’s diseas e, the motor and other symptoms  of Parkinson’s disease must
be present well before (by convention, at leas t 1 year prior) cognit ive decline has reached
the level of major NCD, whereas in major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies, cognitive symp-
toms begin shortly before, or concurrent wi th, motor symptoms. For mild NCD, the timing
is harder to establish because the diagnosis itse lf is less clear and th e two disorders exist on
a continuum. Unless Parkinson’s disease has been established for some time prior to the
onset of cognitive decline, or typical features  of major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies are
present, it is preferable to diagnose unspecified mild NCD",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,683

"Major or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder. Major or mild vascular NCD may pre-
sent with parkinsonian features such as psychomotor slowing that may occur as a conse-
quence of subcortical small vessel disease. However, the parkinsonian features typically
are not sufficient for a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, and the course of the NCD usually
has a clear association with cerebrovascular changes",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,683
"Neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., neurodegenerative
disorders). When a diagnosis of major or mild NC D due to Parkinson’s disease is being
considered, the distinction must also be made from other brain diso rders, such as progres-
sive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, tumors, and
hydrocephalus. 
Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism can occur in
individuals with other NCDs, particularly when dopamine-blocking drugs are prescribed

drugs and other medical conditio ns (e.g., sedation or impair ed cognition, severe hypothy-
roidism, B12 deficiency) must al so be ruled out. 
Comorbidity 
Parkinson’s disease may coexist with Alzheimer’ s disease and cerebrovascular disease, espe-
cially in older individuals. The compounding of  multiple pathological features may diminish

Diagnostic Features
Progressive cognitive impairment is a core feature of Huntington ’s disease, with early changes
in executive function (i.e., processing speed, organization, and planni ng) rather than learn-
ing and memory. Cognitive and associated beha vioral changes often precede the emergence
of the typical motor abnormalities of bradykinesia (i.e., slowing of voluntary movement)
and chorea (i.e., involuntary jerking movements). A diagnosis of definite Huntington’s dis-
ease is given in the presence of unequivocal,  extrapyramidal motor ab normalities in an in-
dividual with either a family history of Huntington’s disease or genetic testing showing a
CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene, located on chromosome 4",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,684
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Depression, irritability, anxiety, obsessive -compulsive symptoms, and apathy are fre-
quently, and psychosis more rarely, associat ed with Huntington’s disease and often pre-
cede the onset of motor symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,684
"Prevalence
Neurocognitive deficits are an eventual ou tcome of Huntington’s disease; the worldwide
prevalence is estimated to be 2.7 per 100,000.  The prevalence of Huntington’s disease in
North America, Europe, and Australia is 5.7 pe r 100,000, with a much lower prevalence of
0.40 per 100,000 in Asia. 
Development and Course
The average age at diagnosis of Huntington’s disease is approximately 40 years, although
this varies widely. Age at onset is inversely correlated with CAG expansion length. Juve-
nile Huntington’s disease (ons et before age 20) may present more commonly with brady-
kinesia, dystonia, and rigidity than with the choreic movements characteristic of the adult-
onset disorder. The disease is gradually progre ssive, with median survival approximately
15 years after motor symptom diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,684
"Phenotypic expression of Huntington’s diseas e varies by presence of motor, cognitive,
and psychiatric symptoms. Psychiatric and co gnitive abnormalities can predate the motor
abnormality by at least 15 years. Initial symp toms requiring care often include irritabity,
anxiety, or depressed mood. Other behavioral  disturbances may include pronounced ap-
athy, disinhibition, impulsivit y, and impaired insight, with apathy often becoming more
progressive over time. Early movement symptoms may involve the appearance of fidget-
iness of the extremitie s as well as mild apraxia  (i.e., difficulty with purposeful movements),
particularly with fine motor tasks. As the disorder progre sses, other motor problems in-
clude impaired gait (ataxia ) and postural instability. Motor impairment eventually affects
speech production ( dysarthria ) such that the speech becomes very difficult to understand,",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,684

which may result in significant distress resu lting from the communication barrier in the
context of comparatively intact cognition. Advanced motor disease severely affects gait
with progressive ataxia. Eventually individuals become nonambulatory. End-stage motor
disease impairs motor control of eating and swallowing, typically a major contributor to
the death of the individual from aspiration pneumonia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,685
"Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Genetic and physiological. The genetic basis of Huntington’s disease is a fully penetrant
autosomal dominant expansion of th e CAG trincleotide, often called a CAG repeat  in the
huntingtin gene. A repeat length of 36 or more  is invariably associated with Huntington’s
disease, with longer repeat lengths associated  with early age at onset. A CAG repeat length
of 36 or more is invariably asso ciated with Huntington’s disease",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,685
"Diagnostic Markers
Genetic testing is the primary laboratory test  for the determination of Huntington’s dis-
ease, which is an autosomal dominant disord er with complete penetrance. The trinucleo-
tide CAG is observed to have a repeat ex pansion in the gene that encodes huntingtin
protein on chromosome 4. A di agnosis of Huntington’s disease is not made in the presence
of the gene expansion alone, but the diagno sis is made only after symptoms become man-
ifest. Some individuals with a positive family  history request genetic testing in a presymp-
tomatic stage. Associat ed features may also include neur oimaging changes; volume loss in
the basal ganglia, particularly the caudate nu cleus and putamen, is well known to occur
and progresses over the course of illness. Other structural and functional changes have
been observed in brain imagin g but remain research measures",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,685

hibition and personality changes, are highly associated with functional decline. Cognitive
deficits that contribute most to functional decline may incl ude speed of processing, initi-
ation, and attention rather th an memory impairment. Given that Huntington’s disease on-
set occurs in productive years of life, it may have a very disruptive effect on performance
in the work setting as well as social and fam ily life. As the disease progresses, disability
from problems such as impair ed gait, dysarthria, and impulsive or irritable behaviors may
substantially add to the level of impairment and daily care needs, over and above the care
needs attributable to the cognitive decline.  Severe choreic moveme nts may substantially
interfere with provision of care such  as bathing, dressing, and toileting",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,685

A number of other medical co nditions can cause neurocognitive disorders (NCDs). These
conditions include structural lesions (e.g., primary or secondary brain tumors, subdural
hematoma, slowly progressive or normal-press ure hydrocephalus), hypoxia related to hy-
poperfusion from heart failure, endocrine co nditions (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypercalce-
mia, hypoglycemia), nutritional conditions (e.g., deficiencies of thiamine or niacin), other
infectious conditions (e.g., neurosyphilis, cryptococcosis), im mune disorders (e.g., tempo-
ral arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus), hepatic or rena l failure, metabolic conditions
(e.g., Kufs’ disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, other storage
diseases of adulthood and childhood), and ot her neurological conditions (e.g., epilepsy,
multiple sclerosis). Unusual causes of central nervous system injury, such as electrical
shock or intracranial radiation, are generally evident from the history. The temporal asso-
ciation between the onset or exacerbation of  the medical condition and the development of
the cognitive deficit offers the greatest supp ort that the NCD is induced by the medical
condition. Diagnostic certainty regarding this relationship may be increased if the neuro-
cognitive deficits ameliorate partially or stab ilize in the context of treatment of the medical
condition. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,686

"645Personality
 Disorders
This chapter begins  with a general definition of personality disorder that applies
to each of the 10 specific  personality disorders. A personality disorder  is an enduring pattern
of inner experience and behavior  that deviates markedly from the expectations of the in-
dividual’s culture, is pervasive and inflexible , has an onset in adolescence or early adult-
hood, is stable over time, and lead s to distress or impairment. 
With any ongoing review process, especially  one of this complexity, different view-
points emerge, and an effort was made to accommodate them. Thus, personality disorders
are included in both Sections II and III. The material in Section II represents an update of
text associated with the same criteria foun d in DSM-IV-TR, whereas Section III includes
the proposed research model for personality disorder diagnosis and conceptualization de-
veloped by the DSM-5 Personality and Persona lity Disorders Work Group. As this field
evolves, it is hoped that both versions will serve clinical practice and research initiatives,
respectively",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,690

The personality disorders are grouped into thre e clusters based on descriptive similarities,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,691
"Cluster A includes paranoid, schizoid, and schi zotypal personality diso rders. Individuals with
these disorders often appear odd or eccentric. Cluster B includes antisocial, borderline, histri-
onic, and narcissistic personality disorders. In dividuals with these disorders often appear dra-
matic, emotional, or erratic. Cluster C in cludes avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-
compulsive personality disorders. Individuals with these disorders often appear anxious or
fearful. It should be noted that this clustering system, although useful in some research and ed-
ucational situations, has serious limitations and has not been consistently validated. 
Moreover, individuals freque ntly present with co-occu rring personality disorders
from different clusters. Prevalence estimates fo r the different clusters suggest 5.7% for dis-
orders in Cluster A, 1.5% for disorders in Cl uster B, 6.0% for disorders in Cluster C, and
9.1% for any personality disorder, indicating frequent co-occurrence of disorders from dif-
ferent clusters. Data from the 2001–2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and
Related Conditions suggest that  approximately 15% of U.S. adults have at least one per-
sonality disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,691
"Dimensional Models for Personality Disorders
The diagnostic approach used in this manual  represents the categorical perspective that
personality disorders are qualit atively distinct clinical synd romes. An alternative to the
categorical approach is the dimensional perspective that personality disorders represent
maladaptive variants of personality traits that merge imperceptibly into normality and
into one another. See Section III for a full description of a dimensional model for person-
ality disorders. The DSM-IV personality disord er clusters (i.e., odd-eccentric, dramatic-
emotional, and anxious- fearful) may also be viewed as dimensions representing spectra of
personality dysfunction on a continuum with other mental disorders. The alternative di-
mensional models have much in common and together appear to cover the important ar-
eas of personality dysfunction. Their integration, clinical utility, and relationship with the
personality disorder diagnostic categories and various aspects of personality dysfunction
are under active investigation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,691

"Diagnostic Features
Personality traits  are enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the en-
vironment and oneself that are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal contexts",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,692
"Only when personality traits are inflexible and maladaptive and cause significant func-
tional impairment or subjective distress do th ey constitute personality disorders. The essen-
tial feature of a personality disorder is an en during pattern of inner experience and behavior
that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture and is manifested
in at least two of the following areas: cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning, or im-
pulse control (Criterion A). This  enduring pattern is inflexib le and pervasive across a broad
range of personal and social sit uations (Criterion B) and leads to clinically significant dis-
tress or impairment in social, occupational, or  other important areas of functioning (Crite-
rion C). The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least
to adolescence or early adulthood (Criterion D). The pattern is not better explained as a
manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder (Criterion E) and is not attribut-
able to the physiological effects of a substanc e (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure
to a toxin) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma) (Criterion F). Specific diagnostic
criteria are also provided for each of the pe rsonality disorders included in this chapter. 
The diagnosis of personality disorders requires an evaluation of the individual’s long-
term patterns of functioning, and the partic ular personality features must be evident by
early adulthood. The personality traits that define these disorders must also be distin-
guished from characteristics th at emerge in response to sp ecific situational stressors or
more transient mental states (e .g., bipolar, depressive, or an xiety disorders; substance in-
toxication). The clinician should assess the stability of pers onality traits over time and
across different situations. Although a single interview with the in dividual is sometimes
sufficient for making the diagnosis, it is of ten necessary to conduct more than one inter-
view and to space these over time. Assessment ca n also be complicated by the fact that the
characteristics that define a personality di sorder may not be considered problematic by
the individual (i.e., the traits are often ego-sy ntonic). To help overcome this difficulty, sup-
plementary information from other informants may be helpful",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,692
"Development and Course
The features of a personality disorder usually become recogn izable during adolescence or
early adult life. By definition, a personality disorder is an enduring pattern of thinking,
feeling, and behaving that is relatively stable  over time. Some types of personality disorder
(notably, antisocial and borderli ne personality disorders) tend to become less evident or to
remit with age, whereas this appears to be less true for some other types (e.g., obsessive-
compulsive and schizotypal personality disorders)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,692
"Personality disorder categories may be app lied with children or adolescents in those
relatively unusual instances in which the individual’s particular maladaptive personality
traits appear to be pervasive, persistent, an d unlikely to be limited to a particular devel-
opmental stage or another mental disorder. It sh ould be recognized that the traits of a per-
sonality disorder that appear in childhood will often not persist unchanged into adult life",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,692

sonality disorder, which cannot be diagnosed in individuals younger than 18 years. Al-
though, by definition, a personality disorder requires an onset no later than early
adulthood, individuals may not come to clinical attention until relatively late in life. A per-
sonality disorder may be exacer bated following the loss of significant supporting persons
(e.g., a spouse) or previously stabilizing social situations (e.g ., a job). However, the devel-
opment of a change in person ality in middle adulthood or later life warrants a thorough
evaluation to determine the possible presence of a personality change due to another med-
ical condition or an unrecogn ized substance use disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,693
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Judgments about personality functioning must take into account the in dividual’s ethnic, cul-
tural, and social background. Personality disord ers should not be confused with problems as-
sociated with acculturation following immigratio n or with the expressi on of habits, customs,
or religious and political values professed by the individual’s culture of origin. It is useful for
the clinician, especially when evaluating some one from a different background, to obtain ad-
ditional information from informants who are fa miliar with the person’s cultural background",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,693
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Certain personality disorders (e.g., antisocial personality disorder) are diagnosed more
frequently in males. Others (e.g., borderline, histrionic, and dependent personality disor-
ders) are diagnosed more freque ntly in females. Although these differences in prevalence
probably reflect real gender differences in the presence of such patterns, clinicians must be
cautious not to overdiagnose or underdiagnos e certain personality disorders in females or
in males because of social stereotypes about typical gender roles and behaviors",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,693
"Differential Diagnosis
Other mental disorders and personality traits. Many of the specific criteria for the per-
sonality disorders describe features (e.g., su spiciousness, dependency, insensitivity) that
are also characteristic of episo des of other mental disorders. A personality disorder should
be diagnosed only when the defining characte ristics appeared before  early adulthood, are
typical of the individual’s long-term function ing, and do not occur exclusively during an
episode of another mental diso rder. It may be particularly difficult (and not particularly
useful) to distinguish personality disorders from persistent mental disorders such as per-
sistent depressive disorder that have an ea rly onset and an enduring, relatively stable
course. Some personality diso rders may have a “spectrum” relationship to other mental
disorders (e.g., schizotypal personality disord er with schizophrenia; avoidant personality
disorder with social anxiety disorder [social phobia]) based on phe nomenological or bio-
logical similarities or familial aggregation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,693
"Personality disorders must be distinguished from personality traits that do not reach
the threshold for a personality disorder. Person ality traits are diagnosed as a personality
disorder only when they are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant
functional impairment or subjective distress",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,693
"Psychotic disorders. For the three personality disorders that may be related to the psy-
chotic disorders (i.e., paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal), there is an exclusion criterion
stating that the pattern of behavior must no t have occurred exclusively during the course
of schizophrenia, a bipolar or depressive disorder with psycho tic features, or another psy-
chotic disorder. When an individual has a pers istent mental disorder  (e.g., schizophrenia)
that was preceded by a preexisting personalit y disorder, the personality disorder should
also be recorded, followed by “premorbid” in parentheses",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,693

cause these conditions may have cross-sectio nal symptom features that mimic personality
traits and may make it more difficult to evaluate retrospectively the individual’s long-term
patterns of functioning. 
Posttraumatic stress disorder. When personality changes emerge and persist after an
individual has been exposed to  extreme stress, a diagnosis of  posttraumatic stress disorder
should be considered. 
Substance use disorders. When an individual has a substance use disorder, it is impor-
tant not to make a personality disorder diag nosis based solely on behaviors that are con-
sequences of substance intoxication or withdraw al or that are associated with activities in
the service of sustaining substance use (e.g., antisocial behavior). 
Personality change due to another medical condition. When enduring changes in per-
sonality arise as a result of the physiological effects of another medical condition (e.g.,

"650 Personality Disorders
Individuals with this disorder assume that other people will exploit, harm, or deceive
them, even if no evidence exists to support th is expectation (Criterion A1). They suspect on
the basis of little or no eviden ce that others are plotting against them and may attack them
suddenly, at any time and without reason. They often feel that they have been deeply and
irreversibly injured by another person or persons even when there is no objective evidence
for this. They are preoccupied with unjustifie d doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness
of their friends and associates, whose actions are minutely scrutinize d for evidence of hos-
tile intentions (Criterion A2). Any perceived deviation from trustworthiness or loyalty
serves to support their underlying assumptions. They are so amazed when a friend or as-
sociate shows loyalty that they cannot trust or believe it. If they get into trouble, they ex-
pect that friends and associates w ill either attack or ignore them",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,695
"Individuals with paranoid personality disord er are reluctant to confide in or become
close to others because they fear that the information they share will be used against them
(Criterion A3). They may refuse to answer personal questions, saying that the information
is “nobody’s business.” They read hidden meanings that are demeaning and threatening
into benign remarks or events (Criterion A4). For example, an individual with this disor-
der may misinterpret an honest mistake by a store clerk as a deliberate attempt to short-
change, or view a casual humorous remark by  a co-worker as a seri ous character attack",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,695
"Compliments are often misinterpreted (e.g.,  a compliment on a new acquisition is mis-
interpreted as a criticism for selfishness; a compliment on an accomplishment is misinter-
preted as an attempt to coerce more and better performance). They may view an offer of

"Individuals with this disorder persistently bear grudges and are unwilling to forgive
the insults, injuries, or slights that they th ink they have received (Criterion A5). Minor
slights arouse major hostility, and the hostile f eelings persist for a long time. Because they
are constantly vigilant to the harmful intentions of others, they very often feel that their
character or reputation has been attacked or that they have been slighted in some other
way. They are quick to counterattack and react with anger to perceived insults (Criterion
A6). Individuals with this disorder may be pathologically jealous, often suspecting that
their spouse or sexual partner is unfaithful without any adequate ju stification (Criterion
A7). They may gather trivial and circumstantial  “evidence” to support  their jealous beliefs",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,695

"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with paranoid personality disorder are generally difficult to get along with
and often have problems with close relationsh ips. Their excessive suspiciousness and hos-
tility may be expressed in over t argumentativeness, in recurr ent complaining, or by quiet,
apparently hostile aloofness. Because they ar e hypervigilant for potential threats, they
may act in a guarded, secretive, or devious manner and appear to be “cold” and lacking in
tender feelings. Although they may appear to be objective, rational , and unemotional, they
more often display a labile range of affect, with hostile, stub born, and sarcastic expressions
predominating. Their combative and suspicious  nature may elicit a hostile response in
others, which then serves to conf irm their original expectations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,695

have a high degree of control over those around them. They are often rigid, critical of oth-
ers, and unable to collaborate, although they  have great difficulty accepting criticism them-
selves. They may blame others for their own shortcomings. Because of their quickness to
counterattack in response to the threats they perceive around them, they may be litigious
and frequently become involved in legal disputes. Individuals with this disorder seek to
confirm their preconceived nega tive notions regarding people or situations they encounter,
attributing malevolent motivati ons to others that are projections of their own fears. They
may exhibit thinly hidden, unrealistic grandios e fantasies, are often attuned to issues of
power and rank, and tend to develop negative  stereotypes of others, particularly those
from population groups distinct from their own. Attracted by simplistic formulations of the
world, they are often wary of  ambiguous situations. They ma y be perceived as “fanatics”

disorder and may be at increased risk fo r agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive dis-

Some behaviors that are influenced by sociocultural contexts or specific life circumstances
may be erroneously labeled paranoid and may ev en be reinforced by the process of clinical
evaluation. Members of minority groups, immi grants, political and economic refugees, or
individuals of different ethnic backgrounds may display guarded or defensive behaviors
because of unfamiliarity (e.g., language barriers or lack of knowledge of rules and regula-
tions) or in response to the perceived neglect or indifference of the majority society. These
behaviors can, in turn, generate anger and fr ustration in those who deal with these indi-
viduals, thus setting up a vicious cycle of mutual mistrust, which should not be confused
with paranoid personality diso rder. Some ethnic groups also display culturally related be-
haviors that can be misinterpreted as paranoid.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,696

Differential Diagnosis
Other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms. Paranoid personality disorder can
be distinguished from delusional disorder, pe rsecutory type; schizophrenia; and a bipolar or
depressive disorder with psychotic features be cause these disorders are all characterized by a
period of persistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations). For an additional
diagnosis of paranoid personality disorder to be given, the personal ity disorder must have
been present before the onset of psychotic sy mptoms and must persist when the psychotic
symptoms are in remission. When an individual has another persistent mental disorder (e.g.,
schizophrenia) that was preceded by paranoid personality disorder, paranoid personality dis-
order should also be recorded, follo wed by “premorbid” in parentheses",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,697

"It is therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their
characteristic features. However, if an individu al has personality features that meet criteria
for one or more personality disorders in additi on to paranoid personality disorder, all can be
diagnosed. Paranoid personality disorder an d schizotypal personality disorder share the
traits of suspiciousness, interpersonal aloofne ss, and paranoid ideati on, but schizotypal per-
sonality disorder also includes symptoms such as magical thinking, unusual perceptual ex-
periences, and odd thinking and speech. Indivi duals with behaviors th at meet criteria for
schizoid personality disorder ar e often perceived as strange, ec centric, cold, and aloof, but
they do not usually have prominent paranoid ideation. The tendency of individuals with
paranoid personality disorder to react to minor stimuli with anger is also seen in borderline
and histrionic personality disorders. However, these disord ers are not necessarily associ-
ated with pervasive suspiciousness. People with avoidant personality disorder may also be
reluctant to confide in others, but more from fear of being embarrassed or found inadequate
than from fear of others’ malicious intent. Although antisocial behavior may be present in
some individuals with paranoid personality diso rder, it is not usually motivated by a desire
for personal gain or to exploit others as in an tisocial personality diso rder, but rather is more
often attributable to a desire for revenge. In dividuals with narcissistic personality disorder
may occasionally display suspiciousness, social withdrawal, or alienation, but this derives
primarily from fears of having thei r imperfections or flaws revealed. 
Paranoid traits may be adaptive, particul arly in threatening environments. Paranoid

Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of schizo id personality disorder is a pe rvasive pattern of detachment
from social relationships and a restricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal
settings. This pattern begins by early adulth ood and is present in a variety of contexts",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,698
"Individuals with schizoid personality disord er appear to lack a desire for intimacy,
seem indifferent to opportunities to develop close relationships, and do not seem to derive
much satisfaction from being part of a family or other social group (Criterion A1). They
prefer spending time by themselves, rather than being with other people. They often ap-
pear to be socially isolated or “loners” and al most always choose solitary activities or hob-
bies that do not include interaction with others (Criterion A2). They prefer mechanical or
abstract tasks, such as computer or mathemat ical games. They may have very little interest
in having sexual experiences with another person (Criterion A3) and take pleasure in few,
if any, activities (Criterion A4). There is usually a reduced experience of pleasure from sen-
sory, bodily, or interpersonal ex periences, such as walking on a beach at sunset or having
sex. These individuals have no  close friends or confidants, except possibly a first-degree
relative (Criterion A5)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,698
"Individuals with schizoid personality disord er often seem indifferent to the approval
or criticism of others and do not appear to be bothered by what others may think of them
(Criterion A6). They may be oblivious to the no rmal subtleties of social interaction and of-
ten do not respond appropriately to social cues so that they seem socially inept or super-
ficial and self-absorbed. They usually displa y a “bland” exterior without visible emotional
reactivity and rarely reciprocate gestures or facial expressions, such as smiles or nods (Cri-
terion A7). They claim that they rarely expe rience strong emotions such as anger and joy",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,698
"They often display a constricted affect and ap pear cold and aloof. However, in those very
unusual circumstances in which these indivi duals become at least temporarily comfort-

they lack emotion. Their lives sometimes se em directionless, an d they may appear to
“drift” in their goals. Such individuals ofte n react passively to adverse circumstances and
have difficulty responding appropriately to im portant life events. Because of their lack of
social skills and lack of desire for sexual experiences, individuals with this disorder have
few friendships, date infreque ntly, and often do not marry. Occupational functioning may
be impaired, particularly if interpersonal involvement is required, but individuals with
this disorder may do well when they work un der conditions of soci al isolation. Particu-
larly in response to stress, individuals with this disorder may experience very brief psy-
chotic episodes (lasting minutes to hours) . In some instances, schizoid personality
disorder may appear as the pr emorbid antecedent of delusional disorder or schizophre-

"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Individuals from a variety of cultural bac kgrounds sometimes exhibit defensive behaviors
and interpersonal styles that may be erroneously labeled as “schizoid.” For example, those
who have moved from rural to metropolitan  environments may react with “emotional

"Differential Diagnosis
Other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms. Schizoid persona lity disorder can
be distinguished from delusional disorder, sc hizophrenia, and a bipolar or depressive dis-
order with psychotic features because these d isorders are all characterized by a period of

from symptoms that may develop in a ssociation with persistent substance use",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,700
"Other personality disorder s and personality traits. Other personality disorders may be
confused with schizoid personality disorder because they have certain features in com-
mon. It is, therefore, import ant to distinguish among these disorders based on differences
in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that
meet criteria for one or  more personality disorders in addition to schizoid personality dis-
order, all can be diagnosed. Although characteri stics of social isolation and restricted af-
fectivity are common to schizoid, schizotypal, and paranoid personality disorders,
schizoid personality disorder can be distin guished from schizotypa l personality disorder
by the lack of cognitive and perceptual dist ortions and from paranoid personality disorder
by the lack of suspiciousness and paranoid ideation. The social isolation of schizoid per-
sonality disorder can be distinguished from th at of avoidant personality disorder, which is
attributable to fear of being embarrassed or  found inadequate and excessive anticipation
of rejection. In contrast, people with schizoid personality disorder have a more pervasive
detachment and limited desire for social in timacy. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder may also show an apparent social detachment stemming from devo-
tion to work and discomfort wi th emotions, but they do have  an underlying capacity for
intimacy",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,700

The essential feature of schizo typal personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of social
and interpersonal deficits ma rked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for,
close relationships as well as by cognitive or pe rceptual distortions and eccentricities of be-
havior. This pattern begins by early adulthoo d and is present in a variety of contexts",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,701
"Individuals with schizotypal personality disord er often have ideas of reference (i.e., in-
correct interpretations of casual incidents and external events as having a particular and
unusual meaning specifically for the person ) (Criterion A1). Th ese should be distin-
guished from delusions of reference, in whic h the beliefs are held with delusional convic-
tion. These individuals may be superstitiou s or preoccupied with paranormal phenomena
that are outside the norms of their subculture (Criterion A2). They may feel that they have
special powers to sense events before they happen or to read others’ thoughts. They may
believe that they have magical control over  others, which can be implemented directly
(e.g., believing that their spouse’s taking the do g out for a walk is the direct result of think-
ing an hour earlier it should be done) or in directly through compli ance with magical rit-
uals (e.g., walking past a specific object three times to avoid a certain harmful outcome)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,701
"Perceptual alterations may be present (e.g., se nsing that another person is present or hear-
ing a voice murmuring his or her name) (Criterion A3). Their speech may include unusual
or idiosyncratic phrasing and construction. It is often loose, digressive, or vague, but with-
out actual derailment or incoherence (Criteri on A4). Responses can be either overly con-
crete or overly abstract, and words or conc epts are sometimes applied in unusual ways
(e.g., the individual may state that he  or she was not “talkable” at work)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,701
"Individuals with this disorder are often suspicious and may have paranoid ideation
(e.g., believing their colleagues at work ar e intent on undermining their reputation with
the boss) (Criterion A5). They are usually not able to negotiate the fu ll range of affects and
interpersonal cuing required fo r successful relationships and thus often appear to interact
with others in an inappropriate, stiff, or constricted fashion (Criterion A6). These individ-
uals are often considered to be odd or ecce ntric because of unusual mannerisms, an often
unkempt manner of dress that does not quite “fit together,” and inattention to the usual
social conventions (e.g., the in dividual may avoid eye contact, wear clothes that are ink
stained and ill-fitting, and be unable to join in the give-and-take banter of co-workers)

"Individuals with schizotypal personality di sorder experience in terpersonal related-
ness as problematic and are uncomfortable relating to other people. Although they may
express unhappiness about their lack of relationships, their behavior suggests a decreased
desire for intimate contacts. As a result, they  usually have no or few close friends or con-
fidants other than a first-degree relative (Cri terion A8). They are anxious in social situa-
tions, particularly those invo lving unfamiliar people (Crite rion A9). They will interact

"Particularly in response to stress, individual s with this disorder may experience transient
psychotic episodes (lasting minutes to hours), although they usually are insufficient in du-
ration to warrant an additional diagnosis such  as brief psychotic disorder or schizophreni-

Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. Schizotypal personality disord er appears to aggregate fa-

"Other personality disorders and personality traits. Other personality disorders may
be confused with schizotypal personality diso rder because they have certain features in

ences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features
that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to schizotypal person-
ality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although paranoid and schizoid personality disor-
ders may also be characterized by social de tachment and restricted affect, schizotypal
personality disorder can be distinguished fr om these two diagnoses by the presence of
cognitive or perceptual distortions and marked eccentricity or oddn ess. Close relation-
ships are limited in both schizotypal person ality disorder and avoidant personality dis-
order; however, in avoidant personality disorder an active desire for relationships is
constrained by a fear of rejection, whereas in schizotypal personality disorder there is
a lack of desire for relationships and persis tent detachment. Indivi duals with narcissistic

but in narcissistic personality disorder these qualities derive primarily from fears of hav-
ing imperfections or flaws revealed. Individu als with borderline personality disorder may
also have transient, psychotic-like symptoms, but these are usually more closely related to
affective shifts in response to  stress (e.g., intense anger, anxiety, disappointment) and are
usually more dissociative (e.g., derealization, depersonalization). In contrast, individuals

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of disregard
for, and violation of, the rights of others that  begins in childhood or early adolescence and
continues into adulthood. This pattern  has also been referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy,
or dyssocial personality disorder.  Because deceit and manipulation are central features of an-
tisocial personality disorder, it  may be especially helpful to  integrate information acquired
from systematic clinical assessment with information collected from collateral sources",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,704
"For this diagnosis to be given, the individual  must be at least age 18 years (Criterion B)
and must have had a history of some symptoms of conduct disorder before age 15 years
(Criterion C). Conduct disorder involves a repe titive and persistent pattern of behavior in
which the basic rights of othe rs or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are vio-
lated. The specific behaviors characteristic of  conduct disorder fall into one of four cate-
gories: aggression to people and animals, destruction of proper ty, deceitfulness or theft, or
serious violation of rules. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,704
"660 Personality Disorders
The pattern of antisocial behavior continues into adulthood. Indi viduals with antiso-
cial personality disorder fail to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior
(Criterion A1). They may repeatedly perfor m acts that are grounds for arrest (whether
they are arrested or not), such as destroying  property, harassing ot hers, stealing, or pur-
suing illegal occupations. Persons with this di sorder disregard the wishes, rights, or feel-
ings of others. They are freq uently deceitful and manipulative in order to gain personal
profit or pleasure (e.g., to obtain money, sex,  or power) (Criterion A2). They may repeat-
edly lie, use an alias, con others, or malinger. A pattern of impulsiv ity may be manifested
by a failure to plan ahead (Criterion A3). Decisions are made on the spur of the moment,
without forethought and without consideration fo r the consequences to self or others; this
may lead to sudden changes of jobs, residences , or relationships. Individuals with antiso-
cial personality disorder tend to be irrita ble and aggressive and may repeatedly get into
physical fights or commit acts of physical assau lt (including spouse beating or child beat-
ing) (Criterion A4). (Aggressive acts that are required to defend oneself or someone else
are not considered to be evidence for this it em.) These individuals also display a reckless
disregard for the safety of themselves or othe rs (Criterion A5). This may be evidenced in
their driving behavior (i.e., recurrent speedi ng, driving while intoxicated, multiple acci-
dents). They may engage in sexual behavior or  substance use that has a high risk for harm-
ful consequences. They may neglec t or fail to care for a child in a way that puts the child in
danger",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,705
"Individuals with antisocial personality disord er also tend to be consistently and ex-
tremely irresponsible (Criterion A6). Irrespon sible work behavior may be indicated by sig-
nificant periods of unemployme nt despite available job opportunities, or by abandonment
of several jobs without a realistic plan for ge tting another job. There may also be a pattern
of repeated absences fr om work that are not explained by illness either in themselves or in
their family. Financial irresponsibility is indicated by acts such as defaulting on debts, fail-
ing to provide child support, or  failing to support other dependents on a regular basis. In-
dividuals with antisocial personality disorder  show little remorse for the consequences of
their acts (Criterion A7). They  may be indifferent to, or provide a superficial rationaliza-
tion for, having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from someone (e.g., “life’s unfair,” “losers de-
serve to lose”). These individuals may blame the victims for being foolish, helpless, or
deserving their fate (e.g., “he had it coming  anyway”); they may minimize the harmful
consequences of their actions; or they may simply indicate complete indifference. They
generally fail to compensate or make amends  for their behavior. They may believe that
everyone is out to “help number one” and that  one should stop at nothing to avoid being
pushed around",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,705

"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with antisocial personality disord er frequently lack empathy and tend to be
callous, cynical, and contempt uous of the feelings, rights, and sufferings of others. They
may have an inflated and arrogant self-appraisa l (e.g., feel that ordinary work is beneath
them or lack a realistic concern about their current problems or th eir future) and may be
excessively opinionated, self-assured, or coc ky. They may display a glib, superficial charm
and can be quite voluble and verbally facile (e.g., using technical terms or jargon that
might impress someone who is unfamiliar with th e topic). Lack of empathy, inflated self-
appraisal, and superficial charm are features that have been commonly included in tradi-
tional conceptions of psychopathy that may be  particularly distinguishing of the disorder
and more predictive of recidivism in prison  or forensic settings, where criminal, delin-

Twelve-month prevalence rates of antisocial personality diso rder, using criteria from pre-

"Development and Course
Antisocial personality disorder has a chronic course but may become less evident or remit
as the individual grows older, particularly by the fourth deca de of life. Although this re-

The diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is not given to individuals younger than

and continued into adulthood, both a substance use disorder  and antisocial personality
disorder should be diagnosed if the criteria fo r both are met, even though some antisocial

early in a relationship. Howeve r, they may switch quickly from idealizing other people to
devaluing them, feeling that the other person does not care enough, does not give enough,
or is not “there” enough. These individuals can empathize with and nurture other people,
but only with the expectation th at the other person will “be ther e” in return to meet their

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with borderline personality disorder may have a pattern of undermining
themselves at the moment a goal is about to be realized (e.g., dropping out of school just
before graduation; regressing se verely after a discussion of ho w well therapy is going; de-
stroying a good relationship just when it is clear that the relationship could last). Some in-
dividuals develop psychotic-like symptoms (e.g ., hallucinations, body-image distortions,
ideas of reference, hypnagogic phenomena) du ring times of stress. Individuals with this
disorder may feel more secure with transition al objects (i.e., a pet or inanimate possession)
than in interpersonal relationships. Prematur e death from suicide may occur in individu-
als with this disorder, especially in those with co-occurring depressive disorders or sub-
stance use disorders. Physical handicaps may result from self-inflicted abuse behaviors or
failed suicide attempts. Recurrent job losses, in terrupted education, and separation or di-
vorce are common. Physical and sexual abuse, neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental
loss are more common in the childhood histor ies of those with borderline personality dis-
order. Common co-occurring disorders include depressive and bipolar disorders, sub-
stance use disorders, eating disorders (not ably bulimia nervosa), posttraumatic stress
disorder, and attention-defici t/hyperactivity disorder. Bo rderline personality disorder
also frequently co-occurs with the other personality disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,710
"Prevalence
The median population prevalence of border line personality disorder is estimated to be
1.6% but may be as high as 5.9%. The preval ence of borderline personality disorder is
about 6% in primary care sett ings, about 10% among individual s seen in outpatient mental
health clinics, and about 20% among psychiat ric inpatients. The prevalence of borderline
personality disorder may decrease in older age groups. 
Development and Course
There is considerable variability in the course of borderline personality disorder. The most
common pattern is one of chronic instability in early adulthoo d, with episodes of serious
affective and impulsive dyscontrol and high levels of use of health and mental health re-
sources. The impairment from the disorder and the risk of suicide are greatest in the
young-adult years and gradually wane with advancing age. Although the tendency to-
ward intense emotions, impulsivity, and intens ity in relationships is often lifelong, indi-
viduals who engage in therapeutic interv ention often show improvement beginning
sometime during the first year. During their 30s and 40s, the majority of individuals with
this disorder attain greater stability in their relationships and vocational functioning. Fol-
low-up studies of individuals identified thr ough outpatient mental health clinics indicate
that after about 10 years, as many as half of the individuals no longer  have a pattern of be-

Differential Diagnosis
Other personality disorder s and personality traits. Other personality disorders may
be confused with histrionic personality disorder because they have certain features in
common. It is therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on differ-
ences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features
that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to histrionic personal-
ity disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although  borderline personality disorder can also be
characterized by attention seeking, manipulati ve behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions,
it is distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close relationships, and
chronic feelings of deep emptiness and identi ty disturbance. Individuals with antisocial
personality disorder and histrionic personalit y disorder share a tend ency to be impulsive,
superficial, excitement seeking, reckless, seductive, and manipulative, but persons with
histrionic personality disorder tend to be mo re exaggerated in their emotions and do not
characteristically engage in antisocial behavi ors. Individuals with histrionic personality
disorder are manipulative to gain nurturance , whereas those with antisocial personality
disorder are manipulative to gain profit, powe r, or some other material gratification. Al-
though individuals with narcissistic personalit y disorder also crave attention from others,
they usually want praise for their “superiority,” whereas individuals with histrionic per-
sonality disorder are willing to be viewed as frag ile or dependent if this is instrumental in
getting attention. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may exaggerate the
intimacy of their relationships with other pe ople, but they are more apt to emphasize the
“VIP” status or wealth of th eir friends. In dependent personality disorder, the individual
is excessively dependent on othe rs for praise and guidance, but is without the flamboyant,
exaggerated, emotional features of individu als with histrionic personality disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,714
"Many individuals may display histrionic personality traits. Only when these traits are
inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or

Individuals with this disorder have a grandiose sense of self-impor tance (Criterion 1),Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,715
"They routinely overestimate their abilities and in flate their accomplishme nts, often appearing
boastful and pretentious. They may blithely assume that others attribute the same value to
their efforts and may be surprised when the prai se they expect and feel they deserve is not
forthcoming. Often implicit in the inflated ju dgments of their own accomplishments is an un-
derestimation (devaluation) of the contributions of others. Individuals with narcissistic per-
sonality disorder are often preo ccupied with fantasies of unlimit ed success, power, brilliance,
beauty, or ideal love (Criterion 2). They ma y ruminate about “long overdue” admiration and
privilege and compare themselves favora bly with famous or privileged people",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,715
"Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they are superior, spe-
cial, or unique and expect others to recogniz e them as such (Criterion 3). They may feel
that they can only be understood by, and sh ould only associate with, other people who are
special or of high status and may attribute “unique,” “perfect,” or “gifted” qualities to those
with whom they associate. Individuals with th is disorder believe that their needs are spe-
cial and beyond the ken of ordinary people. Their own self-esteem is enhanced (i.e., “mir-
rored”) by the idealized value that they assign  to those with whom they associate. They are
likely to insist on having only the “top” pers on (doctor, lawyer, hair dresser, instructor) or
being affiliated with the “best” institutions but may devalue the credentials of those who dis-
appoint them",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,715
"Individuals with this disorder generally require excessiv e admiration (Criterion 4). Their
self-esteem is almost invariably very fragile.  They may be preoccupied with how well they
are doing and how favorably they are regarded by  others. This often takes the form of a need
for constant attention and admira tion. They may expect their arri val to be greeted with great
fanfare and are astonished if others do not c ovet their possessions. Th ey may constantly fish
for compliments, often with great charm. A sens e of entitlement is ev ident in these individ-
uals’ unreasonable expectation of especially fa vorable treatment (Criterion 5). They expect
to be catered to and are puzzled or furious when this does not happen. For example, they
may assume that they do not have to wait in line and that th eir priorities are so important
that others should defer to them, and then ge t irritated when others fail to assist “in their
very important work.” This sense of entitlement,  combined with a lack of sensitivity to the
wants and needs of others, may result in the conscious or unwitting exploitation of others
(Criterion 6). They expect to be given whatever they want or  feel they need, no matter what
it might mean to others. For example, these individuals may expect great dedication from
others and may overwork them wi thout regard for the impact on  their lives. They tend to
form friendships or romantic relationships only if the other person seems likely to advance
their purposes or otherwise enhance their self -esteem. They often usurp special privileges
and extra resources that they believe th ey deserve because they are so special",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,715

to the hurt their remarks may in flict (e.g., exuberantly telling a former lover that “I am now
in the relationship of a lifetime !”; boasting of health in front of someone who is sick). When
recognized, the needs, desires, or feelings of others are likely to be viewed disparagingly as
signs of weakness or vulnerability. Those who re late to individuals with narcissistic person-
ality disorder typically find an emotional coldness and lack of reciprocal interest",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,716
"These individuals are often envious of others or believe that others are envious of them
(Criterion 8). They may begrudge others their su ccesses or possessions, fe eling that they better
deserve those achievements, admiration, or priv ileges. They may harshly devalue the contri-
butions of others, particularly when those individuals have received acknowledgment or
praise for their accomplishments. Arrogant, haug hty behaviors characterize these individuals;
they often display snobbish, disdainful, or patr onizing attitudes (Criterion 9). For example, an
individual with this disorder may complain about  a clumsy waiter’s “rudeness” or “stupidity”
or conclude a medical evaluation with a condescending evaluation of the physician",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,716
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Vulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with narcissistic personality disorder very
sensitive to “injury” from criticism or defe at. Although they may not show it outwardly,
criticism may haunt these individuals and ma y leave them feeling humiliated, degraded,
hollow, and empty. They may react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack. Such ex-
periences often lead to social withdrawal or an appearance of humility that may mask and
protect the grandiosity. Interpersonal relation s are typically impaired because of problems
derived from entitlement, the need for admira tion, and the relative disregard for the sen-
sitivities of others. Though overweening ambition and confidence may lead to high
achievement, performance may be disrupted beca use of intolerance of criticism or defeat",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,716
"Sometimes vocational functioning can be very low, reflecting an unwillingness to take a
risk in competitive or other situations in wh ich defeat is possible.  Sustained feelings of
shame or humiliation and the attendant self-criticism may be associated with social with-
drawal, depressed mood, and persistent depr essive disorder (dysthymia) or major de-
pressive disorder. In contrast, sustained periods of grandiosity may be associated with a
hypomanic mood. Narcissistic personality disorder is also associated with anorexia ner-
vosa and substance use disorder s (especially related to cocaine). Histrionic, borderline,
antisocial, and paranoid personality disorders may be associated with narcissistic person-
ality disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,716
"Prevalence
Prevalence estimates for narcissistic person ality disorder, based on DSM-IV definitions,
range from 0% to 6.2% in community samples. 
Development and Course
Narcissistic traits may be particularly comm on in adolescents and do not necessarily in-
dicate that the individual will go on to have narcissistic personality disorder. Individuals
with narcissistic personality disorder may have special difficulties adjusting to the onset of
physical and occupational limitations that  are inherent in the aging process.

common. It is, therefore, important to distin guish among these disorders based on differ-
ences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features
that meet criteria for one or more personalit y disorders in addition to narcissistic person-
ality disorder, all can be diagnosed. The most useful feature in discriminating narcissistic
personality disorder from histrionic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders, in
which the interactive styles are coquettish, callous, and needy, respectively, is the grandi-
osity characteristic of narcissistic personalit y disorder. The relative stability of self-image
as well as the relative lack of self-destruc tiveness, impulsivity, an d abandonment concerns
also help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from borderline personality disor-
der. Excessive pride in achievements, a relative  lack of emotional display, and disdain for
others’ sensitivities help distinguish narci ssistic personality disorder from histrionic
personality disorder. Although individuals wi th borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic
personality disorders may requir e much attention, those with narcissistic personality dis-
order specifically need that attention to be admiring. Individuals with antisocial and nar-
cissistic personality disorders share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib, superficial,
exploitative, and unempathic. However, narciss istic personality disorder does not neces-
sarily include characteristics of impulsivity, aggression, and deceit. In addition, individu-
als with antisocial personality disorder may not be as needy of the admiration and envy of
others, and persons with narcissistic personal ity disorder usually lack the history of con-
duct disorder in childhood or criminal behavior in adulthood. In both narcissistic person-
ality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, the individual may profess
a commitment to perfectionism and believe that  others cannot do things as well. In con-
trast to the accompanying self-criticism of those with obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, individuals with narcissistic persona lity disorder are more likely to believe that
they have achieved perfection. Suspiciousness and social withdrawal usually distinguish
those with schizotypal or paranoid personalit y disorder from those with narcissistic per-
sonality disorder. When these qualities are pres ent in individuals with narcissistic person-
ality disorder, they derive primarily from fear s of having imperfections or flaws revealed. 
Many highly successful individuals display pe rsonality traits that might be considered
narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause
significant functional impairment or subjective  distress do they constitute narcissistic per-
sonality disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,717
"Mania or hypomania. Grandiosity may emerge as part of manic or hypomanic episodes,
but the association with mood change or functional impairments helps distinguish these
episodes from narcissistic personality disorder.

"Individuals with avoidant personality disord er avoid work activities that involve sig-
nificant interpersonal contact because of fears of criticism, disapprova l, or rejection (Cri-
terion 1). Offers of job prom otions may be declined because the new responsibilities might
result in criticism from co-workers. These individuals avoid making new friends unless
they are certain they will be liked and accept ed without criticism (Criterion 2). Until they
pass stringent tests proving the contrary, other people are assumed to be critical and dis-
approving. Individuals with this disorder will not join in group activities unless there are
repeated and generous offers of support and nurturance. Inte rpersonal intimacy is often
difficult for these individuals, although they are able to es tablish intimate relationships
when there is assurance of uncritical acceptan ce. They may act with restraint, have diffi-
culty talking about themselves, and withhold intimate feelings for fear of being exposed,
ridiculed, or shamed (Criterion 3)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,718
"Because individuals with this  disorder are preoccupied with being criticized or re-
jected in social situations, they may have a markedly low threshold for detecting such re-
actions (Criterion 4). If someone is even s lightly disapproving or critical, they may feel
extremely hurt. They tend to be shy, quiet, inhibited, and “invisible” because of the fear
that any attention would be degrading or reject ing. They expect that no matter what they
say, others will see it as “wrong,” and so th ey may say nothing at all. They react strongly
to subtle cues that are suggest ive of mockery or derision. Despite their longing to be active
participants in social life, they fear placing their welfare in the hands of others. Individuals
with avoidant personality disorder are inhibi ted in new interpersonal situations because
they feel inadequate and have low self-esteem (Criterion 5). Doubts concerning social
competence and personal appeal become especially manifest in settings involving inter-
actions with strangers. These individuals believe themselves to be socially inept, person-
ally unappealing, or inferior to others (Cri terion 6). They are unusually reluctant to take
personal risks or to engage in any new activities because these may prove embarrassing
(Criterion 7). They are prone to exaggerate the potential dangers of ordinary situations,
and a restricted lifestyle may result from their need for certainty and security. Someone
with this disorder may cancel a job interview for fear of being embarrassed by not dressing
appropriately. Marginal somatic symptoms or  other problems may become the reason for
avoiding new activities",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,718
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with avoidant personality disorder often vigilantly appr aise the movements
and expressions of those with whom they come  into contact. Their fearful and tense de-
meanor may elicit ridicule an d derision from others, which in turn confirms their self-
doubts. These individuals are very anxious about the possibility that they will react to crit-
icism with blushing or crying. They are described by others as being “shy,” “timid,”",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,718

“lonely,” and “isolated.” The major problems associated with this disorder occur in social
and occupational functi oning. The low self-esteem and hy persensitivity to rejection are
associated with restricted in terpersonal contacts. These individuals may become relatively
isolated and usually do not have a large social support ne twork that can help them weather
crises. They desire affection and acceptance and may fantasize about idealized relation-
ships with others. The avoidant behaviors can also adversely affect occupational function-
ing because these individuals try to avoid the types of social situations that may be
important for meeting the basic dema nds of the job or for advancement",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,719
"Other disorders that are commonly diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder in-
clude depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders,  especially social anxiety disorder (social
phobia). Avoidant personality disorder is often diagnosed with dependent personality
disorder, because individuals with avoidant pe rsonality disorder become very attached to
and dependent on those few other people wi th whom they are friends. Avoidant per-
sonality disorder also tends to  be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and with
the Cluster A personality disorders (i.e., paranoid, schizoid, or schizotypal personality

"Development and Course
The avoidant behavior often st arts in infancy or childhood with shyness, isolation, and
fear of strangers and new situations. Although  shyness in childhood is a common precur-
sor of avoidant personality disorder, in most individuals it tends to gradually dissipate as
they get older. In contrast, individuals who go on  to develop avoidant personality disor-
der may become increasingly shy and avoidant  during adolescence and early adulthood,
when social relationships with new people become especially important. There is some
evidence that in adults, avoi dant personality disorder tend s to become less evident or to
remit with age. This diagnosi s should be used with great caution in children and adoles-
cents, for whom shy and avoidant behavi or may be developmentally appropriate",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,719

order, all can be diagnosed. Both avoidant personality disorder and dependent personal-
ity disorder are characterized by  feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and
a need for reassurance. Although the primary focus of concern in avoidant personality
disorder is avoidance of humiliation and reject ion, in dependent pers onality disorder the
focus is on being taken care of. However, avoidant personality disorder and dependent
personality disorder are particularly likely to  co-occur. Like avoidant personality disor-
der, schizoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder are characterized
by social isolation. However, individuals with avoidant personality disorder want to have
relationships with others and feel their loneliness deeply, whereas those with schizoid or
schizotypal personality disorder may be conten t with and even prefer  their social isola-
tion. Paranoid personality disorder and avoida nt personality disorder are both character-
ized by a reluctance to confide in others. Ho wever, in avoidant personality disorder, this

than to a fear of others’ malicious intent",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,720

"Individuals with dependent personality disorder have grea t difficulty making every-
day decisions (e.g., what color shirt to wear to work or whether to carry an umbrella) without
an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others (Criterion 1). These individu-
als tend to be passive and to allow other people  (often a single other person) to take the ini-
tiative and assume responsibility for most majo r areas of their lives (Criterion 2). Adults
with this disorder typically depend on a pa rent or spouse to decide where they should
live, what kind of job they should have, and which neighbors to befriend. Adolescents
with this disorder may allow their parent(s) to  decide what they should wear, with whom
they should associate, how they should spen d their free time, and what school or college
they should attend. This need for others to  assume responsibility goes beyond age-appro-
priate and situation-appropriate requests fo r assistance from others (e.g., the specific
needs of children, elderly persons, and hand icapped persons). Dependent personality dis-
order may occur in an individual who has a serious medical conditio n or disability, but in
such cases the difficulty in taking responsib ility must go beyond what would normally be
associated with that condition or disability",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,721

disorder often have difficulty expressing d isagreement with other individuals, especially
those on whom they are dependent (Criterion 3) . These individuals feel so unable to func-
tion alone that they will agree with things that they feel are wrong rather than risk losing
the help of those to whom they look for guidance. They do not get appropriately angry at
others whose support and nurturance they need for fear of alienating them. If the individ-
ual’s concerns regarding the consequences of expressing disagreement are realistic (e.g.,
realistic fears of retribution from an abusiv e spouse), the behavior should not be consid-
ered to be evidence of dependent personality disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,721
"Individuals with this disorder have difficulty initiating projects or doing things inde-
pendently (Criterion 4). They lack self-confidence and believe that they need help to begin

as a rule others can do them better. These in dividuals are convinced that they are incapable
of functioning independently and present them selves as inept and requiring constant as-
sistance. They are, however, lik ely to function adequately if given the assurance that some-
one else is supervising and approving. There ma y be a fear of becoming or appearing to be
more competent, because they may believe that this will lead to abandonment. Because

traordinary self-sacrifices or tolerate verbal, physical, or sexual abuse.  (It should be noted
that this behavior should be considered evid ence of dependent pers onality disorder only
when it can clearly be established that other options are available to the individual.) Indi-

preoccupied with fears of being left to care fo r themselves (Criterion 8). They see themselves
as so totally dependent on the advice and help  of an important other person that they worry
about being abandoned by that person when ther e are no grounds to justify such fears. To be
considered as evidence of this criterion, the fears must be ex cessive and unrealistic. For ex-

"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals with dependent personality diso rder are often charac terized by pessimism
and self-doubt, tend to belittl e their abilities and assets, and may constantly refer to them-
selves as “stupid.” They take criticism and disapproval as proof of their worthlessness and
lose faith in themselves. They may seek ov erprotection and dominance from others. Oc-
cupational functioning may be impaired if in dependent initiative is required. They may
avoid positions of responsibility and become anxious when faced with decisions. Social re-
lations tend to be limited to those few people  on whom the individual is dependent. There
may be an increased risk of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and adjustment dis-
orders. Dependent personality disorder often co-occurs with other personality disorders,
especially borderline, avoidant, and histrion ic personality disorders. Chronic physical ill-
ness or separation anxiety disorder in childhood or adolescence may predispose the indi-
vidual to the development of this disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,722
"Prevalence
Data from the 2001–2002 National Epidemio logic Survey on Alcohol and Related Condi-
tions yielded an estimated prevalence of depe ndent personality disorder of 0.49%, and de-
pendent personality was estimated, based on a probability subsample from Part II of the
National Comorbidit y Survey Replication, to be 0.6%",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,722

This diagnosis should be used with great caution,  if at all, in children and adolescents, for
whom dependent behavior may be developmentally appropriate",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,722
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
The degree to which dependen t behaviors are considered to be appropriate varies sub-
stantially across different age and sociocultu ral groups. Age and cultural factors need to
be considered in evaluating the diagnostic threshold of each crit erion. Dependent behav-
ior should be considered characteristic of the disorder only when it is clearly in excess of
the individual’s cultural norms or reflects unrealistic concerns. An emphasis on passivity,
politeness, and deferential treatment is characteristic of some societies and may be mis-
interpreted as traits of dependent personality disorder. Similarly, societies may differen-
tially foster and discourage depend ent behavior in males and females. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
In clinical settings, dependent personality d isorder has been diagnosed more frequently in
females, although some studies report simila r prevalence rates among males and females. 
Differential Diagnosis
Other mental disorders and medical conditions. Dependent personality disorder must
be distinguished from dependen cy arising as a consequence of  other mental disorders (e.g.,
depressive disorders, panic disorder, agoraphobia) and as a resu lt of other medical conditions. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,722
"678 Personality Disorders
Other personality disorders and personality traits. Other personality disorders may be
confused with dependent personality disorder because they ha ve certain features in com-
mon. It is therefore important to distinguis h among these disorders based on differences in
their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet cri-
teria for one or more personality disorders in addition to dependent personality disorder, all
can be diagnosed. Although many personality disorders are characterized by dependent
features, dependent personality disorder can be distinguished by its predominantly submis-
sive, reactive, and clinging be havior. Both dependent person ality disorder and borderline
personality disorder are characterized by fe ar of abandonment; however, the individual
with borderline personality disorder reacts to  abandonment with feelings of emotional emp-
tiness, rage, and demands, whereas the individual with dependent personality disorder re-
acts with increasing appeasement and submissiveness and urgently seeks a replacement
relationship to provide caregiving and suppor t. Borderline personalit y disorder can further
be distinguished from dependen t personality disorder by a ty pical pattern of unstable and
intense relationships. Individual s with histrionic personality disorder, like those with de-
pendent personality disorder, ha ve a strong need for reassu rance and approval and may ap-
pear childlike and clinging. However, unli ke dependent personality disorder, which is
characterized by self-effacing and docile behavior, histrionic personality disorder is charac-
terized by gregarious flamboyance with acti ve demands for attention. Both dependent
personality disorder and avoidant personality di sorder are characterized by feelings of in-
adequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and a need for reassurance; however, individuals
with avoidant personality disorder have such a strong fear of humiliation and rejection that
they withdraw until they are certain they will be accepted. In  contrast, individuals with de-
pendent personality disorder have a pattern of  seeking and maintaining connections to im-
portant others, rather than avoiding  and withdrawing fr om relationships",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,723
"Many individuals display dependent personalit y traits. Only when these traits are in-
flexible, maladaptive, and persisting and caus e significant functional impairment or sub-

"Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of obse ssive-compulsive personality disorder is a preoccupation
with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of

in a variety of contexts",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,724
"Individuals with obse ssive-compulsive personality disorder attempt to maintain a
sense of control through painstaking attention to rules, trivial details, procedures, lists,
schedules, or form to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost (Criterion 1). They
are excessively careful and prone to repetiti on, paying extraordinary attention to detail
and repeatedly checking for possible mistakes. They are oblivious to the fact that other
people tend to become very annoyed at the de lays and inconveniences that result from this
behavior. For example, when such individuals misplace a list of things to be done, they
will spend an inordinate amount  of time looking for the list  rather than spending a few
moments re-creating it from memory and proceeding to accomplish the tasks. Time is
poorly allocated, and the most important tasks are left to the last moment. The perfection-
ism and self-imposed high standards of performance cause significant dysfunction and
distress in these individuals. They may beco me so involved in maki ng every detail of a
project absolutely perfect that the project is never finished (Criterion 2). For example, the
completion of a written report is delayed by  numerous time-consuming rewrites that all
come up short of “perfection.” Deadlines are missed, and aspects of the individual’s life
that are not the current focus of activity may fall into disarray",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,724
"Individuals with obsessive-compulsive pers onality disorder display excessive devotion
to work and productivity to th e exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (Criterion 3)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,724
"This behavior is not accounted for by economic necessity. They often f eel that they do not
have time to take an evening or a weekend day of f to go on an outing or to just relax. They
may keep postponing a pleasurable activity, such as a vacation, so that it may never occur",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,724
"When they do take time for leisure activities or vacations, they are very uncomfortable un-
less they have taken along some thing to work on so they do not “waste time.” There may be
a great concentration on househ old chores (e.g., repeated excessive cleaning so that “one
could eat off the floor”). If they spend time with friends, it is likely to be in some kind of for-
mally organized activity (e.g., sports). Hobbies  or recreational activities are approached as
serious tasks requiring careful organization and hard work to master. The emphasis is on
perfect performance. These individuals turn play  into a structured task (e.g., correcting an
infant for not putting ring s on the post in the right order; tell ing a toddler to ride his or her tri-
cycle in a straight line; turning a baseball game into a harsh “lesson”)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,724

rion 4). They may force themselves and othe rs to follow rigid moral principles and very
strict standards of performance. They may al so be mercilessly self-c ritical about their own
mistakes. Individuals with this disorder are rigidly deferential to authority and rules and
insist on quite literal compliance, with no ru le bending for extenuating circumstances. For

"Individuals with this disorder may be unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects,
even when they have no sentimental value (C riterion 5). Often these individuals will ad-
mit to being “pack rats.” They regard discar ding objects as wastef ul because “you never
know when you might need something” and will become upset if someone tries to get rid of
the things they have saved. Their spouses or roommates may complain about the amount of
space taken up by old parts, magazines, broken appliances, and so on. 
Individuals with obsessive-compulsive pers onality disorder are reluctant to delegate
tasks or to work with others (Criterion 6). They stubbornly and unreasonably insist that
everything be done their way and that people  conform to their way of doing things. They
often give very detaile d instructions about how things should be done (e.g., there is one
and only one way to mow the lawn, wash the dishes, build a doghouse) and are surprised
and irritated if others suggest creative alternat ives. At other times they may reject offers of
help even when behind schedule because th ey believe no one else can do it right",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,725
"Individuals with this disorder may be miserly and stingy and maintain a standard of
living far below what they can afford, believing that spending must be tightly controlled to
provide for future catastrophes (Criterion 7) . Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
is characterized by rigidity and stubbornness (Criterion 8). Individuals with this disorder
are so concerned about having things done the one “correct” way that they have trouble
going along with anyone else’s ideas. These individuals plan ahead in meticulous detail
and are unwilling to consider changes. Totally  wrapped up in their own perspective, they
have difficulty acknowledging the viewpoints of others. Friends and colleagues may be-
come frustrated by this constant rigidity. Even when individuals with obsessive-compul-
sive personality disorder recognize that it may be in their interest to compromise, they
may stubbornly refuse to do  so, arguing that it is “t he principle of the thing.”
Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
When rules and established procedures do not dictate the correct answer, decision making
may become a time-consuming, often painfu l process. Individuals with obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder may have such difficulty deciding which tasks take pri-
ority or what is the best way of doing some pa rticular task that they may never get started
on anything. They are prone to become upset or angry in situations in which they are not
able to maintain control of their physical or interpersonal environment, although the an-
ger is typically not expressed di rectly. For example, an individual may be angry when ser-
vice in a restaurant is poor, but instead of complaining to the management, the individual
ruminates about how much to leave as a tip. On other occasions, anger may be expressed
with righteous indignation over a seemingly minor matter. Individuals with this disorder
may be especially attentive to their relative  status in dominance-submission relationships
and may display excessive deference to an au thority they respect and excessive resistance
to authority they do not respect",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,725
"Individuals with this disorder usually expres s affection in a highly  controlled or stilted
fashion and may be very uncomfortable in the presence of others who are emotionally ex-
pressive. Their everyday relationships have a formal and serious quality, and they may be
stiff in situations in which others would smile  and be happy (e.g., greeting a lover at the
airport). They carefully hold th emselves back until they are sure that whatever they say
will be perfect. They may be preoccupied with  logic and intellect, and intolerant of affec-
tive behavior in others. They often have diffi culty expressing tender feelings, rarely pay-
ing compliments. Individuals with this disord er may experience occupational difficulties

In assessing an individual for obsessive-com pulsive personality disorder, the clinician
should not include those behaviors that reflect habits, customs, or interpersonal styles that
are culturally sanctioned by the individual’s  reference group. Certain cultures place sub-
stantial emphasis on work and productivity; the resulting behaviors in members of those
societies need not be considered indications of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,726

Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Despite the similarity in names, OCD is usually easily
distinguished from obsessive-comp ulsive personality disorder by  the presence of true ob-

ality disorder and OCD are met, bo th diagnoses should be recorded",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,726
"Hoarding disorder. A diagnosis of hoarding disorder should be considered especially
when hoarding is extreme (e.g., accumulated st acks of worthless objects present a fire haz-

on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to obsessive-
compulsive personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Individuals with narcissistic per-
sonality disorder may also profess a commitmen t to perfectionism and believe that others
cannot do things as well, but these individuals are more likely to believe that they have
achieved perfection, whereas those with obse ssive-compulsive personality disorder are
usually self-critical. Individuals with narcissi stic or antisocial personality disorder lack
generosity but will indulge themselves, wher eas those with obsessive-compulsive person-
ality disorder adopt a miserly spending style toward both self and others. Both schizoid
personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive  personality disorder may be characterized
by an apparent formality and social detachme nt. In obsessive-compulsive personality dis-

manifested as a marked deviat ion from normal development rather than as a change in a
stable personality pattern (Criterion A). There must be evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings that the personality change is the direct physiological
consequence of another medical condition (Crite rion B). The diagnosis is not given if the
disturbance is better explained by another ment al disorder (Criterion C). The diagnosis is
not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion
D). The disturbance must also ca use clinically significant distress or impairment in social,

lation to other paraphilic disorders, and some  of them entail actions for their satisfaction
that, because of their noxiousness or potentia l harm to others, are classed as criminal of-
fenses. The eight listed disorders do not exha ust the list of possible  paraphilic disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,730
"Many dozens of distinct paraphilias have be en identified and named, and almost any of
them could, by virtue of its negative consequences for the individual or for others, rise to
the level of a paraphilic disorder. The diagno ses of the other specified and unspecified
paraphilic disorders are therefore indispensable and will be required in many cases",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,730
"In this chapter, the order of  presentation of the listed paraphilic disorders generally
corresponds to common classification scheme s for these conditions. The first group of
disorders is based on anomalous activi ty preferences.  These disorders are subdivided into
courtship disorders,  which resemble distorted components of human courtship behavior
(voyeuristic disorder, exhibitionistic di sorder, and frotteuristic disorder), and algolagnic
disorders,  which involve pain and suffering (sexual masochism disorder and sexual sadism
disorder). The second group of disorders is based on anomalous target preferences.  These
disorders include one directed at other hu mans (pedophilic disorder) and two directed
elsewhere (fetishistic  disorder and tran svestic disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,730
"The term paraphilia  denotes any intense and persistent sexual interest other than sexual
interest in genital stimulation or preparator y fondling with phenotypically normal, phys-
ically mature, consenting human partners. In some circumstances, the criteria “intense
and persistent” may be difficult to apply, su ch as in the assessment of persons who are
very old or medically ill and who may not have  “intense” sexual interests of any kind. In
such circumstances, the term paraphilia  may be defined as any sexual interest greater than
or equal to normophilic sexual interests. There are also spec ific paraphilias that are gen-
erally better described as preferential  sexual interests than as intense sexual interests",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,730
"Some paraphilias primarily concern the indivi dual’s erotic activities, and others pri-
marily concern the individual’s erotic targets. Examples of  the former would include in-
tense and persistent interests in spanking, whipping, cutting, binding, or strangulating
another person, or an interest in these activiti es that equals or exceeds the individual’s in-
terest in copulation or equivalent interaction with another person. Examples of the latter
would include intense or preferential sexual in terest in children, corp ses, or amputees (as
a class), as well as intense or preferential in terest in nonhuman animals, such as horses or
dogs, or in inanimate obje cts, such as shoes or articles made of rubber",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,730

others. A paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic dis-
order, and a paraphilia by itself does not nece ssarily justify or require clinical intervention",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,731
"In the diagnostic criteria set for each of the listed paraphilic disorder s, Criterion A specifies
the qualitative nature of the paraphilia (e.g., an erotic focus on children or on exposing the gen-
itals to strangers), and Criterio n B specifies the negative conseq uences of the paraphilia (i.e.,
distress, impairment, or harm to  others). In keeping with the distinction between paraphilias
and paraphilic disorders, the term diagnosis  should be reserved for individuals who meet both
Criteria A and B (i.e., individuals who have a pa raphilic disorder). If an individual meets Cri-
terion A but not Criterion B for a particular paraphilia—a circumstance that might arise when
a benign paraphilia is discovered during the clinical investigation of some other condition—
then the individual may be said to have that paraphilia but not a paraphilic disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,731
"It is not rare for an individual to manifest tw o or more paraphilias. In some cases, the para-
philic foci are closely related and the connectio n between the paraphilias is intuitively com-
prehensible (e.g., foot fetishism and shoe fetish ism). In other cases, th e connection between the
paraphilias is not obvious, and the presence of mu ltiple paraphilias may be coincidental or else
related to some generalized vulnerability to an omalies of psychosexual development. In any
event, comorbid diagnoses of separate paraphil ic disorders may be warranted if more than
one paraphilia is causing suffering to the individual or harm to others",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,731
"Because of the two-pronged nature of diag nosing paraphilic disorders, clinician-rated
or self-rated measures and se verity assessments could addre ss either the strength of the
paraphilia itself or the seriousness of its co nsequences. Although the distress and impair-
ment stipulated in the Criterio n B are special in being the im mediate or ultimate result of
the paraphilia and not primarily the result of some other factor, the phenomena of reactive
depression, anxiety, guilt, poor work history, impaired social relations, and so on are not
unique in themselves and may be quantified  with multipurpose measures of psychosocial
functioning or quality of life",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,731
"The most widely applicable framework for assessing the strength of a paraphilia itself
is one in which examinees’ paraphilic sexual fa ntasies, urges, or beha viors are evaluated in
relation to their normophilic sexual interests and behaviors. In a clinical interview or on
self-administered questionnair es, examinees can be asked whether their paraphilic sexual
fantasies, urges, or behaviors are weaker th an, approximately equal to, or stronger than
their normophilic sexual intere sts and behaviors. This same type of comparison can be,
and usually is, employed in psychophysiological  measures of sexual interest, such as pe-

"Specifiers
The “in full remission” specifier does not address the continued presence or absence of
voyeurism per se, which may still be present af ter behaviors and dist ress have remitted. 
Diagnostic Features
The diagnostic criteria for voyeuristic disorder can apply both to individuals who more or less
freely disclose this paraphilic interest and to those who categorically deny any sexual arousal
from observing an unsuspecting person who is na ked, disrobing, or engaged in sexual activity
despite substantial objective evidence to the cont rary. If disclosing individuals also report dis-
tress or psychosocial problems because of thei r voyeuristic sexual pref erences, they could be
diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. On the ot her hand, if they declare no distress, demon-
strated by lack of anxiety, obse ssions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses and are
not impaired in other im portant areas of functioning because of this sexual interest, and their
psychiatric or legal histories indicate that they  do not act on it, they could be ascertained as
having voyeuristic sexual interest but should not  be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. 
Nondisclosing individuals include, for example, individuals known to have been spy-
ing repeatedly on unsuspecting persons who ar e naked or engaging in sexual activity on
separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies concerning such sexual behavior,
and who may report that known episodes of wa tching unsuspecting naked or sexually ac-
tive persons were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of ob-
serving unsuspecting naked or sexually ac tive persons but contest any significant or
sustained sexual interest in this behavior. Since these individuals deny having fantasies or
impulses about watching others nude or involv ed in sexual activity, it follows that they
would also reject feeling subjectively distressed  or socially impaired by such impulses. De-
spite their nondisclosing stance, such individuals may be diagnosed with voyeuristic dis-
order. Recurrent voyeuristic behavior cons titutes sufficient suppo rt for voyeurism (by
fulfilling Criterion A) and simult aneously demonstrates that this paraphilically motivated
behavior is causing harm to ot hers (by fulfilling Criterion B)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,732
"“Recurrent” spying on unsuspecting persons who are naked or engaging in sexual ac-
tivity (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate oc casion) may, as a general rule, be inter-
preted as three or more victim s on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as
satisfying this criterion if there were multiple  occasions of watching the same victim or if
there is corroborating evidence of a distinct or preferential interest in secret watching of
naked or sexually acti ve unsuspecting persons. Note th at multiple victims, as suggested
earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary cond ition for diagnosis; the criteria may also be
met if the individual acknowledges intense voyeuristic sexual interest. 
The Criterion A time frame, indicating that  signs or symptoms of voyeurism must have
persisted for at least 6 months , should also be understood as a general guideline, not a
strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual in terest in secretly watching unsuspecting naked
or sexually active others is not merely transient. 
Adolescence and puberty generally increase sexual curiosity and activity. To alleviate
the risk of pathologizing normative sexual in terest and behavior during pubertal adoles-
cence, the minimum age for the diagnosis of voye uristic disorder is 18 years (Criterion C)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,732

tic disorder is approximately 12% in males and 4% in females",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,733
"Development and Course
Adult males with voyeuristic disorder often first become aware of their sexual interest in
secretly watching unsuspecti ng persons during adolescence. However, the minimum age
for a diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years because there is substantial difficulty in
differentiating it from age-appropriate pubert y-related sexual curiosity and activity. The
persistence of voyeurism over time is unclear. Voyeuristic disorder, however, per defini-
tion requires one or more contributing factors that may change over time with or without
treatment: subjective distress (e.g., guilt, sh ame, intense sexual fr ustration, loneliness),
psychiatric morbidity, hypersex uality, and sexual impulsivit y; psychosocial impairment;
and/or the propensity to act out sexually by spying on unsuspecting naked or sexually ac-
tive persons. Therefore, the course of voyeuristic disorder is likely to vary with age",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,733

consenting individuals could be prepubescent children, adults, or both. This specifier should
help draw adequate attention to  characteristics of victims of individuals with exhibitionistic

Prevalence
The prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder is unknown. However, based on exhibitionistic
sexual acts in nonclinical or general populati ons, the highest possible prevalence for exhi-
bitionistic disorder in the male population is 2%–4%. The prevalence of exhibitionistic dis-
order in females is even more uncertain but is  generally believed to be much lower than in
males. 
Development and Course
Adult males with exhibitionistic disorder often report that they first became aware of sex-
ual interest in exposing their genitals to unsuspecting persons during adolescence, at a
somewhat later time than the typical development of normative sexual interest in women
or men. Although there is no minimum age re quirement for the diagno sis of exhibitionis-
tic disorder, it may be difficult to different iate exhibitionistic be haviors from age-appro-
priate sexual curiosity in adolescents. Wher eas exhibitionistic impulses appear to emerge
in adolescence or early adulthood, very little is known about persistence over time. By def-
inition, exhibitionistic disord er requires one or more contributing factors, which may
change over time with or without treatment; subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense
sexual frustration, lo neliness), mental disorder comorb idity, hypersexuality, and sexual
impulsivity; psychosocial impair ment; and/or the propensity to act out sexually by expos-

Prevalence
Frotteuristic acts, including the uninvited sexu al touching of or rubbing against another

"Frotteuristic Disorder 693
10%–14% of adult males seen in outpatient se ttings for paraphilic disorders and hypersex-
uality have a presentation that meets diagnost ic criteria for frotteuristic disorder. Hence,
whereas the population prev alence of frotteuristic disorder  is unknown, it is not likely that
it exceeds the rate found in selected clinical settings. 
Development and Course
Adult males with frotteuristic disorder often re port first becoming aware of their sexual in-
terest in surreptitiously touching unsuspecting persons during late adolescence or emerging
adulthood. However, children and adolescents may also touch or rub against unwilling oth-
ers in the absence of a diagnosis of frotteuris tic disorder. Although th ere is no minimum age
for the diagnosis, frotteuristic disorder can be difficult to di fferentiate from conduct-disor-
dered behavior without sexual motivation in individuals at younger ages. The persistence of
frotteurism over time is unclear. Frotteuristic disorder, however, by de finition requires one
or more contributing factors that may change over time with or without treatment: subjec-
tive distress (e.g., guilt, shame,  intense sexual frustration, loneliness); psychiatric morbidity;
hypersexuality and sexual impulsivity; psycho social impairment; and/ or the propensity to
act out sexually by touching or  rubbing against unconsenting persons. Therefore, the course
of frotteuristic disorder is like ly to vary with age. As with other sexual preferences, advanc-
ing age may be associated with decreasing fr otteuristic sexual preferences and behavior. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. Nonsexual antisocial behavior and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality
might be nonspecific risk factors, although the causal relationship to frotteurism is uncertain
and the specificity unclear. However, frotteurism is a necessary precondition for frotteuristic
disorder, so risk factors for frot teurism should also increase the rate of frotteuristic disorder. 
Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
There appear to be substantially fewer female s with frotteuristic sexual preferences than
males.

Conduct disorder and antiso cial personality disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents
and antisocial personality disorder would be  characterized by additional norm-breaking
and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in touching or rubbing against a

lants such as cocaine and amphetamines, might involve single frotteuristic episodes by in-
toxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sustained sexual interest in

"Sexual Sadism Disorder 695
Development and Course
Community individuals with paraphilias have reported a mean age at onset for masoch-
ism of 19.3 years, although earlier ages, in cluding puberty and childhood, have also been
reported for the onset of masochistic fantasi es. Very little is known about persistence over
time. Sexual masochism disorder per definition  requires one or more contributing factors,
which may change over time with or without treatment. These include subjective distress
(e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration,  loneliness), psychiatri c morbidity, hypersex-
uality and sexual impulsivity, and psychosocial  impairment. Therefore, the course of sex-
ual masochism disorder is likely to vary with age. Advancing age is likely to have the same
reducing effect on sexual preference involvin g sexual masochism as it has on other para-
philic or normophilic sexual behavior. 
Functional Consequences of Sexual Masochism Disorder
The functional consequences of sexual maso chism disorder are unknown. However, mas-
ochists are at risk of accidental death while practicing asphyxiophilia or other autoerotic
procedures. 
Differential Diagnosis
Many of the conditions that could be differ ential diagnoses for sexual masochism disorder
(e.g., transvestic fetishism, sexual sadism di sorder, hypersexuality, alcohol and substance
use disorders) sometimes occur also as comorbid diagnoses. Therefore, it is necessary to
carefully evaluate the evidence for sexual masochism disorder, keep ing the possibility of
other paraphilias or other mental  disorders as part of the di fferential diagnosis. Sexual
masochism in the absence of distress (i.e., no disorder) is also includ ed in the differential,

"696 Paraphilic Disorders
Diagnostic Features
The diagnostic criteria for sexual sadism disord er are intended to apply both to individuals
who freely admit to having such paraphilic interests and to those who deny any sexual interest
in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual despite substantial objective
evidence to the contrary. Indivi duals who openly acknowledge in tense sexual interest in the
physical or psychological suffering of others are referred to as “admitting individuals.” If these
individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual  attractions or prefer-
ences for the physical or psychological suffering of another individual, they may be diagnosed
with sexual sadism disorder. In contrast, if admitting individuals declare no distress, exempli-
fied by anxiety, obsessions, gu ilt, or shame, about these para philic impulses, and are not ham-
pered by them in pursuing other goals, and thei r self-reported, psychiat ric, or legal histories
indicate that they do not act on them, then they  could be ascertained as having sadistic sexual
interest but they would not meet criteria for sexual sadism disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,741
"Examples of individuals who deny any interest in the physical or psychological suffering
of another individual include in dividuals known to have inflicted pain or suffering on mul-
tiple victims on separate occasions but who de ny any urges or fantasies about such sexual
behavior and who may further claim that known episodes of sexual assault were either un-
intentional or nonsexual. Others may admit past  episodes of sexual behavior involving the
infliction of pain or suffering on a nonconsenting individual but do not report any significant
or sustained sexual interest in the physical or  psychological suffering of another individual",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,741
"Since these individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving sexual arousal to pain and
suffering, it follows that they would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or socially im-
paired by such impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder
despite their negative self-report. Their recurrent behavior constitutes clinical support for
the presence of the paraphilia of sexual sadi sm (by satisfying Criterion A) and simultane-
ously demonstrates that their paraphilically motivated behavior is causing clinically signif-
icant distress, harm, or risk of harm  to others (satisfying Criterion B)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,741
"“Recurrent” sexual sadism invo lving nonconsenting others (i .e., multiple victims, each
on a separate occasion) may, as general rule , be interpreted as three or more victims on
separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpre ted as satisfying this criterion, if there are
multiple instances of infliction of pain and su ffering to the same victim, or if there is cor-
roborating evidence of a strong  or preferential interest in  pain and suffering involving
multiple victims. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not
a necessary condition for diagnosis, as the crit eria may be met if the individual acknowl-
edges intense sadistic sexual interest. 
The Criterion A time frame, indicating that  the signs or symptoms of sexual sadism
must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guide-
line, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in inflicting pain and suffering
on nonconsenting victims is not merely tran sient. However, the diagnosis may be met if
there is a clearly sustaine d but shorter period of sadistic behaviors.

Diagnostic Features
The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who
freely disclose this paraphilia and to individuals who deny any sexual attraction to prepuber-
tal children (generally age 13 years or younger) , despite substantial objective evidence to the
contrary. Examples of disclosing this paraphilia include candidly acknowledging an intense
sexual interest in children and indicating that sexual interest in children is greater than or equal
to sexual interest in physically mature individuals. If individuals also complain that their sex-
ual attractions or preferences for children are caus ing psychosocial difficulties, they may be di-
agnosed with pedophilic disorder. However, if they report an absence of feelings of guilt,
shame, or anxiety about these impulses and are not functionally limited by their paraphilic im-
pulses (according to self-repor t, objective assessment, or both), and their self-reported and le-
gally recorded histories indicate that they ha ve never acted on their impulses, then these
individuals have a pedophilic sexual interest but not pedophilic disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,743
"Examples of individuals who deny attraction to children include individuals who are
known to have sexually approached multiple children on separate occasions but who deny
any urges or fantasies about sexual behavior involving children, and who may further claim
that the known episodes of physical contact were  all unintentional and nonsexual. Other indi-
viduals may acknowledge past episodes of sexual behavior involving children but deny any
significant or sustained sexual interest in children. Since these individuals may deny experi-
ences impulses or fantasies involving children, they may also deny feeling subjectively dis-
tressed. Such individuals may still be diagnosed with pedophilic disorder despite the absence
of self-reported distress, provided that there is  evidence of recurrent behaviors persisting for
6 months (Criterion A) and evidence that the individual has acted on sexual urges or experi-
enced interpersonal difficulties as a cons equence of the disorder (Criterion B)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,743
"Presence of multiple victims, as discussed above, is su fficient but not necessary for di-
agnosis; that is, the individual can still meet  Criterion A by merely acknowledging intense
or preferential sexual interest in children. 
The Criterion A clause, indicating that the signs or symptoms of pedophilia have per-
sisted for 6 months or longer, is  intended to ensure that the sexual attraction to children is
not merely transient. However, the diagnosis ma y be made if there is  clinical evidence of
sustained persistence of the sexual attraction to children even if the 6-month duration can-
not be precisely determined",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,743

ulation prevalence of pedophilic disorder in females is even more  uncertain, but it is likely
a small fraction of the prevalence in males.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,743

Development and Course
Adult males with pedophilic disorder may indi cate that they become aware of strong or
preferential sexual interest in children arou nd the time of puberty—the same time frame
in which males who later prefer physically ma ture partners became aware of their sexual
interest in women or men. Attempting to diag nose pedophilic disorder at the age at which
it first manifests is problematic because of th e difficulty during adolescent development in
differentiating it from age-appropriate sexual interest in peers or from sexual curiosity",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,744

older than the child or children in Criterion A",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,744
"Pedophilia per se appears to be a lifelong condition. Pedophilic disorder, however,
necessarily includes other elements that may change over time with or without treatment:
subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense se xual frustration, or feelings of isolation) or
psychosocial impairment, or the propensity to  act out sexually with children, or both",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,744
"Therefore, the course of pedophilic disorder may fluctuate, in crease, or decr ease with age",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,744
"Adults with pedophilic disorder may report an awareness of sexual interest in children
that preceded engaging in sexual behavior invo lving children or self-identification as a pedo-
phile. Advanced age is as likely to similarly di minish the frequency of sexual behavior involv-
ing children as it does other paraphilically  motivated and normophilic sexual behavior",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,744
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Temperamental. There appears to be an interaction between pedophilia and antisocial-
ity, such that males with both traits are more  likely to act out sexually with children. Thus,
antisocial personality disorder may be consid ered a risk factor for pedophilic disorder in
males with pedophilia. 
Environmental. Adult males with pedophilia often repo rt that they were sexually abused
as children. It is unclear, however, whether this correlation reflects a causal influence of
childhood sexual abuse on adult pedophilia",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,744
"Genetic and physiological. Since pedophilia is a necessary condition for pedophilic dis-
order, any factor that increase s the probability of pedophilia al so increases the risk of pe-
dophilic disorder. There is some  evidence that neurodevelopme ntal perturbation in utero
increases the probability of develo pment of a pedoph ilic interest",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,744
"Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues
Psychophysiological laboratory measures of sexu al interest, which are sometimes useful in di-
agnosing pedophilic disorder in males, are not necessarily useful in diagnosing this disorder in

penile plethysmography and vaginal photoplethysmography) are available",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,744
"Diagnostic Markers
Psychophysiological measures of sexual interest  may sometimes be useful when an indi-

denies strong or preferential  attraction to children. The most thoroughly researched and
longest used of such measures is penile plethysmography, although the sensitivity and spec-
ificity of diagnosis may vary from one site to another. Viewing time,  using photographs of
nude or minimally clothed person s as visual stimuli, is also used to diagnose pedophilic
disorder, especially in combination with self-report measures. Mental health professionals
in the United States, however, should be aware that possession of such visual stimuli, even
for diagnostic purposes, may violate American  law regarding possession of child pornog-
raphy and leave the mental health professio nal susceptible to criminal prosecution.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,744

Specifiers
Although individuals with fetishistic disord er may report intens e and recurrent sexual
arousal to inanimate objects or a specific body part, it is not unusual for non–mutually ex-
clusive combinations of fetishes  to occur. Thus, an individual may have fetishistic disorder
associated with an inanimate object (e.g., fe male undergarments) or an exclusive focus on
an intensely eroticized body part (e.g., feet, ha ir), or their fetishisti c interest may meet cri-
teria for various combinations of these specifiers (e.g., socks, shoes and feet)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,746
"Diagnostic Features
The paraphilic focus of fetishistic disorder involves the persistent and repetitive use of or de-
pendence on nonliving objects or a highly specif ic focus on a (typically nongenital) body part
as primary elements associated with sexual arous al (Criterion A). A diagnosis of fetishistic dis-
order must include clinically significant pers onal distress or psycho social role impairment
(Criterion B). Common fetish objects include female undergarments, male or female footwear,
rubber articles, leather cl othing, or other wearing apparel. Hi ghly eroticized body parts asso-
ciated with fetishistic disorder include feet, toes, and hair. It is not uncommon for sexualized
fetishes to include both inanimate objects and bo dy parts (e.g., dirty socks and feet), and for
this reason the definition of feti shistic disorder now re-incorporates partialism (i.e., an exclusive
focus on a body part) into its boundaries. Part ialism, previously considered a paraphilia not
otherwise specified disorder, ha d historically been subsumed in fetishism prior to DSM-III",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,746
"Many individuals who self-identify as fetish ist practitioners do not necessarily report
clinical impairment in association with their fetish-associated behavi ors. Such individuals
could be considered as having a fetish but not fetishistic diso rder. A diagnosis of fetishistic
disorder requires concurrent fulfillment of both the behaviors in Criterion A and the clin-
ically significant distress or impairment in functioning noted in Criterion B",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,746
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Fetishistic disorder can be a multisensory ex perience, including holding, tasting, rubbing,
inserting, or smelling the fetish object while ma sturbating, or preferring that a sexual part-
ner wear or utilize a fetish object during sexual encounters. Some individuals may acquire
extensive collections of high ly desired fetish objects",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,746
"Development and Course 
Usually paraphilias have an onset during pube rty, but fetishes can develop prior to ado-
lescence. Once established, fetish istic disorder tends to have a continuous course that fluc-
tuates in intensity and freq uency of urges or behavior.

"Differential Diagnosis
Transvestic disorder. The nearest diagnostic neighbor of  fetishistic diso rder is transves-
tic disorder. As noted in the diagnostic criter ia, fetishistic disorder is not diagnosed when
fetish objects are limited to ar ticles of clothing exclusively worn during cross-dressing (as
in transvestic disorder), or when the object is genitally stimulating because it has been de-
signed for that purpose (e.g., a vibrator). 
Sexual masochism disorder or  other paraphilic disorders. Fetishes can co-occur with
other paraphilic disorders, especially “sad omasochism” and transvestic disorder. When
an individual fantasizes about or engages in “forced cross-dressing” and is primarily sex-
ually aroused by the domination or humiliation  associated with such fantasy or repetitive
activity, the diagnosis of sexual ma sochism disorder should be made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,747

"Transvestic Disorder 703
Specifiers
The presence of fetishism decreases the likelih ood of gender dysphoria in men with trans-
vestic disorder. The presence of autogynephilia increases the likelihood of gender dyspho-
ria in men with transvestic disorder. 
Diagnostic Features
The diagnosis of transvestic diso rder does not apply to all individuals who dress as the op-
posite sex, even those who do so habitually. It applies to individuals whose cross-dressing
or thoughts of cross-dressing are always or of ten accompanied by sexual excitement (Cri-
terion A) and who are emotionally distressed by this pattern or feel it impairs social or in-
terpersonal functioning (Crite rion B). The cross-dressing may involve only one or two
articles of clothing (e.g., for men, it may pertain only to women’s undergarments), or it
may involve dressing completely in the inner and outer garments of the other sex and (in
men) may include the use of women’s wigs and make-up. Transvestic disorder is nearly
exclusively reported in males. Sexual arousal, in its most obvious form of penile erection,
may co-occur with cross-dressing in various wa ys. In younger males, cross-dressing often
leads to masturbation, following which any fe male clothing is removed. Older males often
learn to avoid masturbating or doing anything to stimulate the penis so that the avoidance
of ejaculation allows them to prolong their cr oss-dressing session. Males with female part-
ners sometimes complete a cro ss-dressing session by having intercourse with their part-
ners, and some have difficult y maintaining a sufficient erec tion for intercourse without
cross-dressing (or private fantasies of cross-dressing)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,748
"Clinical assessment of distress or impairme nt, like clinical assessment of transvestic
sexual arousal, is usually dependent on the in dividual’s self-report. The pattern of behav-
ior “purging and acquisition” often signifies the presence of  distress in individuals with
transvestic disorder. During this behavioral pattern, an individual (usually a man) who
has spent a great deal of money on women’s clothes and other apparel (e.g., shoes, wigs)
discards the items (i.e., purges  them) in an effort to overc ome urges to cross-dress, and
then begins acquiring a woman’s wardrobe all over again",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,748
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Transvestic disorder in men is often accompanied by autogynephilia  (i.e., a male’s para-
philic tendency to be sexually aroused by th e thought or image of himself as a woman)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,748
"Autogynephilic fantasies and behaviors may focu s on the idea of exhibiting female phys-
iological functions (e.g., lactat ion, menstruation), engaging in stereotypically feminine be-
havior (e.g., knitting), or posses sing female anatomy (e.g., breasts)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,748
"Prevalence
The prevalence of transvestic di sorder is unknown. Transvesti c disorder is rare in males
and extremely rare in females.  Fewer than 3% of males repo rt having ever been sexually
aroused by dressing in women’s attire. The percentage of individuals who have cross-
dressed with sexual arousal more than once or  a few times in their lifetimes would be even
lower. The majority of males with transvesti c disorder identify as heterosexual, although
some individuals have occasional sexual in teraction with other males, especially when
they are cross-dressed. 
Development and Course
In males, the first signs of transvestic disorder may begin in childhood, in the form of
strong fascination with a particular item of women’s attire. Prior to  puberty, cross-dress-
ing produces generalized feelings of pleasura ble excitement. With the arrival of puberty,
dressing in women’s clothes begins to elicit pe nile erection and, in some cases, leads di-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,748
"704 Paraphilic Disorders
rectly to first ejaculation. In many cases, cross-dressing elicits less and less sexual ex-
citement as the individual grows older; eventually it may produce no discernible penile
response at all. The desire to cross-dress, at  the same time, remains the same or grows even
stronger. Individuals who report such a dimi nution of sexual response typically report
that the sexual excitement of cross-dressing has been replaced by feelings of comfort or
well-being",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,749
"In some cases, the course of transvestic disorder is contin uous, and in others it is epi-
sodic. It is not rare for men with transvestic d isorder to lose interest  in cross-dressing when
they first fall in love with a woman and be gin a relationship, but such abatement usually
proves temporary. When the desire to cross-dr ess returns, so does the associated distress",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,749
"Some cases of transvestic disorder progress  to gender dysphoria. The males in these
cases, who may be indistinguishable from othe rs with transvestic disorder in adolescence
or early childhood, gradually develop desires to remain in the female role for longer pe-
riods and to feminize their anatomy. The de velopment of gender dysphoria is usually ac-
companied by a (self-reported) reduction or e limination of sexual arousal in association
with cross-dressing",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,749
"The manifestation of transvestism in penile erection and stimulation, like the manifesta-
tion of other paraphilic as well as normophilic sexual interests, is most intense in adolescence
and early adulthood. The severity of transvestic disorder is highest in adulthood, when the
transvestic drives are most likely to conflict  with performance in he terosexual intercourse
and desires to marry and start a family. Middle -age and older men with a history of trans-
vestism are less likely to present with transvestic disorder  than with gender dysphoria",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,749
"Functional Consequences of Transvestic Disorder
Engaging in transvestic behaviors can interfer e with, or detract from, heterosexual rela-
tionships. This can be a source of distress to  men who wish to maintain conventional mar-
riages or romantic partnerships with women",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,749
"Differential Diagnosis
Fetishistic disorder. This disorder may resemble transv estic disorder, in particular, in
men with fetishism who put on women’s unde rgarments while masturbating with them",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,749
"Distinguishing transvestic disorder depends on  the individual’s specific thoughts during
such activity (e.g., are there any ideas of be ing a woman, being like a woman, or being
dressed as a woman?) and on the presence of othe r fetishes (e.g., soft, silky fabrics, whether
these are used for garments or for something else). 
Gender dysphoria. Individuals with transvestic disorder do not report an incongruence be-
tween their experienced gender and assigned gender nor a desire to be of the other gender; and
they typically do not have a history of chil dhood cross-gender behaviors, which would be
present in individuals with gender dysphoria. Individuals with a presentation that meets full
criteria for transvestic disorder as well as ge nder dysphoria should be given both diagnoses",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,749
"Comorbidity
Transvestism (and thus transvestic disorder) is often found in associ ation with other para-
philias. The most frequently co-occurring paraphilias are fetishism and masochism. One
particularly dangerous form of masochism, autoerotic asphyxia,  is associated with transves-
tism in a substantial proportion of fatal cases. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,749

Diagnostic Features
Patients have generally been exposed to a dopamine antagonist within 72 hours prior to
symptom development. Hyperthermia ( 100.4 F or 38.0C on at least two occasions,
measured orally), associated with profuse dia phoresis, is a distinguishing feature of neu-
roleptic malignant syndrome, sett ing it apart from other neurol ogical side effects of anti-
psychotic medications. Extreme elevations in temperature, reflecting a breakdown in
central thermoregulation, are more likely to support the diagnosis of neuroleptic malig-
nant syndrome. Generalized rigidity, described as “lead pipe” in its most severe form and
usually unresponsive to antiparkinsonian agen ts, is a cardinal feature of the disorder and
may be associated with other neurological symptoms (e.g., tremor, sialorrhea, akinesia,
dystonia, trismus, myoclonus,  dysarthria, dysphagia, rhab domyolysis). Creatine kinase
elevation of at least four times the upper limit of normal is commonly seen. Changes in
mental status, characterized by  delirium or altered consciousness ranging from stupor to
coma, are often an early sign. Affected indi viduals may appear alert but dazed and unre-
sponsive, consistent with catatonic stupor. Autonomic activation and instability—mani-
fested by tachycardia (rate 25% above baseline), diaphoresis, blood pressure elevation
(systolic or diastolic 25% above baseline) or fluctuation ( 20 mmHg diastolic change or
25 mmHg systolic change within 24 hours), urinary incontinence, and pallor—may be
seen at any time but provide an early clue to the diagnosis. Tachypnea (rate 50% above
baseline) is common, and respiratory distress —resulting from metabolic acidosis, hyper-
metabolism, chest wall restriction, aspiration pneumonia, or pulmonary emboli—can oc-
cur and lead to sudden respiratory arrest",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,755
"A workup, including laboratory investigation,  to exclude other infectious, toxic, met-
abolic, and neuropsychiatric et iologies or complications is essential (see the section “Dif-
ferential Diagnosis” later in this discussion ). Although several laboratory abnormalities
are associated with neuroleptic malignant synd rome, no single abnormality is specific to
the diagnosis. Individuals with neuroleptic malignant syndrome may have leukocytosis,
metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, decreased serum iron concentrations, and elevations in se-
rum muscle enzymes and catecholamines. Findings from cerebrospinal fluid analysis and
neuroimaging studies are generally normal, whereas electroencephalography shows gen-
eralized slowing. Autopsy findings in fatal ca ses have been nonspecific and variable, de-
pending on complications",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,755
"Development and Course
Evidence from database studies suggests in cidence rates for neuroleptic malignant syn-
drome of 0.01%–0.02% among indi viduals treated with antips ychotics. The temporal pro-
gression of signs and symptoms provides important clues to the diagnosis and prognosis
of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Alteration  in mental status and other neurological
signs typically precede systemic signs. The on set of symptoms varies from hours to days
after drug initiation. Some cases develop with in 24 hours after drug initiation, most within
the first week, and virtually all cases within 30 days. Once the syndrome is diagnosed and
oral antipsychotic drugs are d iscontinued, neuroleptic maligna nt syndrome is self-limited
in most cases. The mean reco very time after drug discontinuation is 7–10 days, with most
individuals recovering within 1 week and nearly all within 30 days. The duration may be
prolonged when long-acting antipsychotics are implicated. There have been reports of in-
dividuals in whom residual neurological signs persisted for weeks after the acute hyper-
metabolic symptoms re solved. Total resolution of symp toms can be obtained in most
cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome; howe ver, fatality rates of 10%–20% have been
reported when the disorder is not recogniz ed. Although many individuals do not experi-
ence a recurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome when rechallenged with antipsy-
chotic medication, some do, especially when antipsychotics are reinstituted soon after an

abrupt cessation (or marked re duction in dose) of an antide pressant medication that was
taken continuously for at least 1 month. Symp toms generally begin within 2–4 days and
typically include specific sensory, somatic,  and cognitive-emotional manifestations. Fre-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,757
"Medication-Induced Movement Disorders 713
quently reported sensory and somatic symptoms  include flashes of lights, “electric shock”
sensations, nausea, and hyperre sponsivity to nois es or lights. Nons pecific anxiety and
feelings of dread may also be reported. Symptoms are alleviated by restarting the same
medication or starting a different medication that has a similar mechanism of action—
for example, discontinuation symptoms afte r withdrawal from a serotonin-norepineph-
rine reuptake inhibitor may be alleviated by starting a tricyclic antidepressant. To qualify
as antidepressant discontinuation syndrome, the symptoms should not have been present
before the antidepressant dosa ge was reduced and are not be tter explained by another
mental disorder (e.g., manic or hypomanic episode, substance intoxication, substance
withdrawal, somatic symptom disorder)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,758
"Diagnostic Features
Discontinuation symptoms may occur following treatment with tricyclic antidepressants
(e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine) , serotonin reuptake in hibitors (e.g., fluox-
etine, paroxetine, sertraline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine, selegi-
line, pargyline). The incidence of this syndrome  depends on the dosage and half-life of the
medication being taken, as well as the rate at  which the medication is tapered. Short-acting
medications that are stopped ab ruptly rather than tapered gradually may pose the great-
est risk. The short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is the
agent most commonly associated with disconti nuation symptoms, but such symptoms oc-
cur for all types of antidepressants",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,758
"Unlike withdrawal syndromes associated with  opioids, alcohol, and other substances
of abuse, antidepressant discontinuation sy ndrome has no pathognomonic symptoms. In-
stead, the symptoms tend to be vague and variable and typically begin 2–4 days after the
last dose of the antidepressant. For SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine), symptoms such as dizziness,
ringing in the ears, “electric shocks in the head ,” an inability to sleep, and acute anxiety are
described. The antidepressant use prior to discontinuation must not have incurred hypo-
mania or euphoria (i.e., there should be confidence that the discontinuation syndrome is
not the result of fluctuations in mood stabi lity associated with the previous treatment)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,758
"The antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is based solely on pharmacological factors
and is not related to the reinforcing effects of an antidepressant. Also, in the case of stim-
ulant augmentation of an antidepressant, abru pt cessation may result in stimulant with-
drawal symptoms (see “Stimulant Withdraw al” in the chapter “Substance-Related and
Addictive Disorders”) rather than the antide pressant discontinuation syndrome described
here",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,758
"Prevalence
The prevalence of antidepressant discontinu ation syndrome is unknown but is thought to
vary according to the dosage prior to discon tinuation, the half-life and receptor-binding
affinity of the medication, and possibly the indi vidual’s genetically influenced rate of me-
tabolism for this medication",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,758
"Course and Development
Because longitudinal studies are lacking, little is known about the clinical course of anti-
depressant discontinuation syndrome. Sympto ms appear to abate over time with very
gradual dosage reductions. After an episode, some individuals may pr efer to resume med-
ication indefinitely if tolerated",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,758
"Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome includes anxiety
and depressive disorders, su bstance use disorders, and tolerance to medications.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,758
"714 Medication-Induced Movement Disorders
Anxiety and depressive disorders. Discontinuation symptoms often resemble symptoms
of a persistent anxiety disorder  or a return of somatic symptoms of depression for which
the medication was initially given",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,759
"Substance use disorders. Antidepressant discontinuatio n syndrome differs from sub-
stance withdrawal in that antidepressants th emselves have no reinforcing or euphoric ef-
fects. The medication dosage has usually not been increased without the clinician’s
permission, and the individual generally does no t engage in drug-seeking behavior to ob-
tain additional medication. Criteria for a substance use disorder are not met",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,759
"Tolerance to medications. Tolerance and discontinuation symptoms can occur as a
normal physiological response to stopping medication after a substantial duration of
exposure. Most cases of medication tolerance can be managed through carefully con-
trolled tapering",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,759
"Comorbidity
Typically, the individual was initially started on the medication for a major depressive dis-
order; the original symptoms may return  during the discontinuation syndrome",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,759

"733 Assessment
 Measures
A growing body  of scientific evidence favors dimensional concepts in the diagnosis
of mental disorders. The limitations of a cate gorical approach to diagnosis include the fail-
ure to find zones of rarity between diagnoses (i.e., delineation of mental disorders from one
another by natural boundaries), the need for in termediate categories like schizoaffective dis-
order, high rates of comorbidity, frequent not-otherwise-specified (NOS) diagnoses, relative
lack of utility in furthering the identification  of unique antecedent validators for most men-
tal disorders, and lack of treatment specif icity for the various di agnostic categories",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,778
"From both clinical and research perspectiv es, there is a need for a more dimensional
approach that can be combined with DSM’s se t of categorical diagnoses. Such an approach
incorporates variations of features within an in dividual (e.g., differential severity of indi-
vidual symptoms both within and outside of a disorder’s diagnostic  criteria as measured
by intensity, duration, or number of symptoms , along with other features such as type and
severity of disabilities) rather than relying on a simple yes-or-no approach. For diagnoses
for which all symptoms are needed  for a diagnosis (a monothetic  criteria set), different se-
verity levels of the constituent symptoms may be noted. If a threshold endorsement of
multiple symptoms is needed, su ch as at least five of nine symptoms for major depressive
disorder (a polythetic criteria  set), both severity levels and different combinations of the
criteria may identify more ho mogeneous diagnostic groups",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,778
"A dimensional approach depending primarily on an individual’s subjective reports of
symptom experiences along with the clinician’s interpretation is consistent with current
diagnostic practice. It is expected that as  our understanding of basic disease mechanisms
based on pathophysiology, neurocircuitry, ge ne-environment interactions, and laboratory
tests increases, approaches that integrate both objective and subjective patient data will be
developed to supplement and enhance the accuracy of the diagnostic process",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,778
"Cross-cutting symptom measures modeled on general medicine’s review of systems can
serve as an approach for reviewing critical psychopathological domains. The general med-
ical review of systems is crucial to detecting subtle changes in different organ systems that
can facilitate diagnosis and treatment. A simi lar review of various mental functions can
aid in a more comprehensive mental status assessment by drawing attention to symptoms
that may not fit neatly into the diagnostic cr iteria suggested by the individual’s presenting
symptoms, but may nonetheless be important to the individual’s care. The cross-cutting
measures have two levels: Level 1 questions ar e a brief survey of 13 symptom domains for
adult patients and 12 domains for child and ad olescent patients. Level 2 questions provide
a more in-depth assessment of certain domains. These measures were developed to be
administered both at initial interview and ov er time to track the patient’s symptom status
and response to treatment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,778
"Severity measures  are disorder-specific, corresponding closely to the criteria that consti-
tute the disorder definition. They may be ad ministered to individuals who have received
a diagnosis or who have a clinically signific ant syndrome that falls short of meeting full
criteria for a diagnosis. Some of the assess ments are self-completed by the individual,
while others require a clinician to complete . As with the cross-cutting symptom measures,
these measures were developed to be administered both at initial interview and over time
to track the severity of the individual’s disorder and response to treatment.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,778

questions. Each item inquires about how mu ch (or how often) the individual has been
bothered by the specific symptom during the p ast 2 weeks. If the individual is of impaired
capacity and unable to complete the form (e .g., an individual with dementia), a knowl-
edgeable adult informant may complete this measure. The measure was found to be clin-

"742 Assessment Measures
Clinician-Rated Dimensions of
Psychosis Symptom Severity
As described in the chapter “Schizophrenia  Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders,”
psychotic disorders are hetero geneous, and symptom severity  can predict important as-
pects of the illness, such as the degree of cogn itive and/or neurobiological deficits. Dimen-
sional assessments capture meaningful variation in the severity of symptoms, which may
help with treatment planning, prognostic decision-making, and research on pathophysi-
ological mechanisms. The Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity
provides scales for the dimensional assessment  of the primary symptoms of psychosis, in-
cluding hallucinations, delusions, disorganiz ed speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior,
and negative symptoms. A scale for the dimensional assessment of cognitive impairment
is also included. Many individuals with psyc hotic disorders have im pairments in a range
of cognitive domains, which predict functional abilities. In addition, scales for dimensional
assessment of depression and mania are provided , which may alert clinicians to mood pa-
thology. The severity of mood symptoms in psychosis has prognostic value and guides
treatment. 
The Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity is an 8-item measure
that may be completed by the clinician at the time of the clinical assessment. Each item asks
the clinician to rate the severity of each sy mptom as experienced by the individual during
the past 7 days",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,787
"Scoring and Interpretation
Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-poin t scale (0=none; 1=equivocal; 2=present, but
mild; 3=present and moderate; and 4=present and severe) with a sy mptom-specific defi-
nition of each rating level. The clinician may review all of the individual’s available infor-
mation and, based on clinical judgment, select (with checkmark) the level that most
accurately describes the severity of the indivi dual’s condition. The clinician then indicates
the score for each item in the “Score” column provided",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,787
"Frequency of Use
To track changes in the indi vidual’s symptom severity over time, the measure may be
completed at regular intervals as clinically in dicated, depending on the stability of the in-

 Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0
The adult self-administered vers ion of the World Health Organization Disability Assessment
Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) is a 36-item measur e that assesses disability in adults age 18
years and older. It assesses disability across six domains, including understanding and
communicating, getting around, self-care, gett ing along with people, life activities (i.e.,
household, work, and/or school activities), an d participation in society. If the adult indi-
vidual is of impaired capacity and unable to complete the form (e.g., a patient with demen-
tia), a knowledgeable informant may complete  the proxy-administered version of the
measure, which is available at www.psychiatry. org/dsm5. Each item on  the self-administered
version of the WHODAS 2.0 asks the individual to rate how much difficulty he or she has
had in specific areas of functioning during the past 30 days",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,790

WHODAS 2.0 summary scores. There are two basic options for computing the summary
scores for the WHODAS 2.0 36-item full version",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,790
"Simple:  The scores assigned to each of the items—“none” (1), “mild” (2), “moderate” (3),
“severe” (4), and “extreme” (5 )—are summed. This method is referred to as simple scoring
because the scores from each of the items are simply added up withou t recoding or collaps-
ing of response categories; thus, there is no we ighting of individual items. This approach is
practical to use as a hand-scoring approach, and may be the method of choice in busy clin-
ical settings or in paper-and-pencil interview situations. As a result, the simple sum of the
scores of the items across all domains constitutes a statistic that is suff icient to describe the
degree of functional limitations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,790
"Complex:  The more complex method of scoring is called “item-response-theory”
(IRT)–based scoring. It takes into account mu ltiple levels of diffic ulty for each WHODAS
2.0 item. It takes the coding for each item response as “none,” “mild,” “moderate,” “se-
vere,” and “extreme” separately, and then uses a computer to determine the summary
score by differentially weighting the items and the levels of severity. The computer pro-
gram is available from the WHO Web site. The scoring has three steps:
• Step 1—Summing of recoded item scores within each domain",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,790
"• Step 3—Converting the summary score in to a metric ranging from 0 to 100 
(where 0=no disability; 100=full disability)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,790

able, he or she may indicate a corrected score in the raw item score box. Based on findings
from the DSM-5 Field Trials in adult patient samples across si x sites in the United States
and one in Canada, DSM-5 recommends calculation and use of average scores for each domain
and for general disability. The average scores are comparab le to the WHODAS 5-point scale,
which allows the clinician to think of the individual’s disability in terms of none (1), mild
(2), moderate (3), severe (4 ), or extreme (5). The averag e domain and general disability
scores were found to be reliable, easy to use, and clinically useful to the clinicians in the
DSM-5 Field Trials. The average domain score  is calculated by dividing the raw domain score
by the number of items in the domain (e.g., if all the items within the “understanding and
communicating” domain are rated as being moderate then the average domain score
would be 18/6=3, indicating moderate disability). The average general disability score  is cal-
culated by dividing the raw overall score by nu mber of items in the measure (i.e., 36). The
individual should be encouraged to complete a ll of the items on the WHODAS 2.0. If no re-
sponse is given on 10 or  more items of the measure (i.e.,  more than 25% of the 36 total
items), calculation of the simple and average general disability scores may not be helpful",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,791
"If 10 or more of the total items on the measur e are missing but the items for some of the do-
mains are 75%–100% complete, the simple or aver age domain scores may be used for those
domains",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,791
"Frequency of use. To track change in the individual’s level of disability over time, the
measure may be completed at regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the
stability of the individual’s symptoms and trea tment status. Consistently high scores on a
particular domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the individual that
might warrant further assessment and intervention.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,791

 Formulation
Understanding the cultural  context of illness experience is essential for effec-
tive diagnostic assessment and clinical management. Culture  refers to systems of knowl-
edge, concepts, rules, and practices that ar e learned and transmitted across generations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,794
"Culture includes language, religion and spirit uality, family structur es, life-cycle stages,
ceremonial rituals, and customs, as well as moral and legal systems. Cultures are open,
dynamic systems that undergo continuous ch ange over time; in the contemporary world,
most individuals and groups are exposed to mu ltiple cultures, which they use to fashion
their own identities and make sense of experi ence. These features of culture make it cru-
cial not to overgeneralize cultur al information or stereotype groups in terms of fixed cul-
tural traits",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,794
"Race  is a culturally constructed category of identity that divides humanity into groups
based on a variety of superficia l physical traits attributed to  some hypothetical intrinsic,
biological characteristics. Racial categories an d constructs have varied widely over history
and across societies. The construct of race has no consistent biological definition, but it is
socially important because it supports racial ideologies, racism, discrimination, and social
exclusion, which can have strong negative effe cts on mental health. There is evidence that
racism can exacerbate many psychiatric disord ers, contributing to poor outcome, and that
racial biases can affect diagnostic assessment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,794
"Ethnicity is a culturally constructed group identity used to define peoples and communi-
ties. It may be rooted in a common history, geography, language, religion, or other shared
characteristics of a group, which distinguish th at group from others. Ethnicity may be self-
assigned or attributed by out siders. Increasing mobility, inte rmarriage, and intermixing of
cultures has defined new mixed, multiple, or hybrid ethnic identities",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,794
"Culture, race, and ethnicity are related to economic inequities, racism, and discrimina-
tion that result in health disparities. Cultural , ethnic, and racial identities can be sources of
strength and group support that enhance resilie nce, but they may also lead to psycholog-
ical, interpersonal, and intergen erational conflict or difficultie s in adaptation that require
diagnostic assessment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,794
"Outline for Cultural Formulation
The Outline for Cultural Formulation introduc ed in DSM-IV provided  a framework for as-
sessing information about cultural features of an individu al’s mental health problem and
how it relates to a social and cultural context and history. DS M-5 not only includes an up-
dated version of the Outline but also presents  an approach to assessment, using the Cul-

background, personal and family places of  birth and growing up, migrant status, and
sexual orientation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,795
"•Cultural conceptualizations of distress:  Describe the cultural constructs that influence
how the individual experiences, understands, and communicates his or her symptoms
or problems to others. These constructs may include cultural syndromes, idioms of dis-
tress, and explanatory models or perceived causes. The level of severity and meaning of
the distressing experiences shou ld be assessed in relation to the norms of the individ-
ual’s cultural reference groups. Assessment of coping and help-seeking patterns should
consider the use of profession al as well as traditional, alternative, or complementary
sources of care",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,795
"•Psychosocial stressors and cultural feat ures of vulnerability and resilience:  Identify
key stressors and supports in the individual ’s social environment (which may include
both local and distant events) and the role of religion, family, and other social networks
(e.g., friends, neighb ors, coworkers) in providing emotional, instrumental, and infor-
mational support. Social stressors and social  supports vary with cultural interpreta-
tions of events, family structure, developm ental tasks, and social context. Levels of
functioning, disability, and resilience should be  assessed in light of the individual’s cul-
tural reference groups",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,795
"•Cultural features of the relationship between the individual and the clinician:  Iden-
tify differences in culture, language, and social status between an individual and clini-
cian that may cause difficulties in communication and may influence diagnosis and
treatment. Experiences of racism and discri mination in the larger society may impede
establishing trust and safety in the clinical  diagnostic encounter. Effects may include
problems eliciting symptoms, misunderstanding of the cultural and clinical signifi-

"Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI)
The Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) is a set of 16 questions that clinicians may use to
obtain information during a me ntal health assessment about the impact of culture on key
aspects of an individual’s clinical presentation and care. In the CFI, culture  refers to
• The values, orientations, kn owledge, and practices that individuals derive from mem-
bership in diverse social groups (e.g., et hnic groups, faith communities, occupational
groups, veterans groups)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,795
"• Aspects of an individual’s background, de velopmental experiences, and current social
contexts that may affect his or her perspe ctive, such as geographical origin, migration,

"• The influence of family, friends, and ot her community members (the individual’s social
network ) on the individual’s illness experience.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,795
"Cultural Formulation 751
The CFI is a brief semistructured  interview for systematically assessing cultural factors
in the clinical encounter that may be used with any individual. The CFI focuses on the in-
dividual’s experience and the so cial contexts of the clinical problem. The CFI follows a per-
son-centered approach to cult ural assessment by eliciting information from the individual
about his or her own views and those of others in his or her social network. This approach
is designed to avoid stereotyping, in that each  individual’s cultural knowledge affects how
he or she interprets illness experience and gu ides how he or she seeks help. Because the
CFI concerns the individual’s personal views, there are no right or wrong answers to these
questions. The interview follows and is available online at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,796
"The CFI is formatted as two text columns. The left-hand column contains the instruc-
tions for administering the CFI and describes the goals for each interview domain. The
questions in the right-hand column illustrate how to explore these domains, but they are
not meant to be exhaustive. Follow-up question s may be needed to clarify individuals’ an-
swers. Questions may be rephrased as needed. Th e CFI is intended as a guide to cultural as-
sessment and should be used flexibly to maintain a natural flow of the interview and rapport
with the individual",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,796
"The CFI is best used in conjunction with  demographic information obtained prior to
the interview in order to tailor the CFI ques tions to address the in dividual’s background
and current situation. Specific demographic do mains to be explored with the CFI will vary
across individuals and settings. A comprehens ive assessment may include place of birth,
age, gender, racial/ethnic origin, marital stat us, family composition,  education, language
fluencies, sexual orientation, religious or sp iritual affiliation, occupation, employment, in-
come, and migration history",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,796
"The CFI can be used in the initial assessment of individuals in all clinical settings, regard-
less of the cultural background of the individual or of the clinician. Individuals and clini-
cians who appear to share the same cultural background may nevertheless differ in ways
that are relevant to care. The CFI may be used in its entirety, or components may be incor-
porated into a clinical evaluation as needed. The CFI may be es pecially helpful when there is
• Difficulty in diagnostic assessment owing to  significant differences in the cultural, re-
ligious, or socioeconomi c backgrounds of clinician and the individual",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,796
• Uncertainty about the fit between culturally distinctive symptoms and diagnostic criteria,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,796
• Disagreement between the individual an d clinician on the course of care,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,796
• Limited engagement in and adherenc e to treatment by the individual,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,796
"The CFI emphasizes four domains of assessmen t: Cultural Definition of the Problem
(questions 1–3); Cultural Perceptions of Caus e, Context, and Support (questions 4–10); Cul-
tural Factors Affecting Self-Coping and Past Help Seeking (questions 11–13); and Cultural
Factors Affecting Current Help Seeking (questions 14–16). Both the person-centered process
of conducting the CFI and the information it el icits are intended to enhance the cultural va-
lidity of diagnostic assessmen t, facilitate treatment planning , and promote the individual’s
engagement and satisfaction. To  achieve these goals, the info rmation obtained from the CFI
should be integrated with all other available clinical material into a comprehensive clinical
and contextual evaluation. An In formant version of the CFI can be used to collect collateral
information on the CFI domains from  family members or caregivers",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,796
"Supplementary modules have b een developed that expand on each domain of the CFI
and guide clinicians who wish to explore th ese domains in greater depth. Supplementary
modules have also been developed for specific populations, such as children and adoles-
cents, elderly individuals, and immigrants and refugees. These supplementary modules
are referenced in the CFI under the pertin ent subheadings and are available online at

"758 Cultural Formulation
Cultural Concepts of Distress
Cultural concepts of distress  refers to ways that cultural groups experience, understand, and
communicate suffering, behavioral problems, or troubling thoughts and emotions. Three
main types of cultural concepts may be distinguished. Cultural syndromes  are clusters of
symptoms and attributions that tend to co -occur among individuals in specific cultural
groups, communities, or contexts and that ar e recognized locally as coherent patterns of
experience. Cultural idioms of distress  are ways of expressing distress that may not involve
specific symptoms or syndromes, but that pr ovide collective, shared ways of experiencing
and talking about personal or social concerns . For example, everyday talk about “nerves”
or “depression” may refer to widely varying forms of suffe ring without mapping onto a
discrete set of symptoms, syndrome, or disorder. Cultural explanations  or perceived causes
are labels, attributions, or features of an ex planatory model that indicate culturally recog-
nized meaning or etiology for symptoms, illness, or distress",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,803
"These three concepts—syndromes, idioms, and explanations—are more relevant to
clinical practice than the older formulation culture-bound syndrome. Specifically, the term
culture-bound syndrome  ignores the fact that clinically important cultural differences often
involve explanations or experience of distress  rather than culturally distinctive configura-
tions of symptoms. Furthermore, the term culture-bound  overemphasizes the local partic-
ularity and limited distribution  of cultural concepts of di stress. The current formulation
acknowledges that all  forms of distress are locally shaped, including the DSM disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,803
"From this perspective, many DSM diagnoses can be understood as operationalized proto-
types that started out as cultural syndromes, and became widely accepted as a result of
their clinical and research utilit y. Across groups there remain  culturally patterned differ-
ences in symptoms, ways of talking about dist ress, and locally perceived causes, which are
in turn associated with coping strategies and patterns of help seeking",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,803
"Cultural concepts arise from local folk or  professional diagnost ic systems for mental
and emotional distress, and they may also re flect the influence of biomedical concepts",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,803
"Cultural concepts have four key featur es in relation to the DSM-5 nosology:
• There is seldom a one-to-one correspondence of any cultural concept with a DSM diag-
nostic entity; the correspondence is more lik ely to be one-to-many in either direction",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,803
"Symptoms or behaviors that might be sort ed by DSM-5 into several disorders may be
included in a single folk concept, and diverse presentations that might be classified by
DSM-5 as variants of a single disorder may be  sorted into several distinct concepts by an
indigenous diagnostic system",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,803
"• Cultural concepts may apply to a wide range of severity, including presentations that
do not meet DSM criteria for any mental disorder. For example, an individual with acute
grief or a social predicament may use the same idiom of distress or display the same
cultural syndrome as another individual  with more severe psychopathology",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,803
"• In common usage, the same cultural term frequently denotes more than one type of
cultural concept. A familiar example may be the concept of “depression,” which may
be used to describe a syndrome (e.g., major depressive disorder), an idiom of distress
(e.g., as in the common expression “I feel depressed”), or a perceived cause (similar to
“stress”)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,803
"• Like culture and DSM itself, cultural concepts  may change over time in response to both
local and global influences",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,803

tions may be associated with particular fe atures of risk, res ilience, and outcome",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,804
"•To improve clinical rapport and engagement:  “Speaking the language of the patient,”
both linguistically and in terms of his or her dominant concepts and metaphors, can re-
sult in greater communication and satisfac tion, facilitate treatment negotiation, and
lead to higher rete ntion and adherence",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,804
"•To improve therapeutic efficacy:  Culture influences the psychological mechanisms of
disorder, which need to be understood and addressed to improve clinical efficacy. For
example, culturally specific catastrophic co gnitions can contribute to symptom escala-
tion into panic attacks",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,804
"•To guide clinical research:  Locally perceived connections  between cultural concepts
may help identify patterns of comorbidity and underlying biological substrates",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,804
"•To clarify the cu ltural epidemiology:  Cultural concepts of distress are not endorsed
uniformly by everyone in a given culture. Distinguishing syndromes, idioms, and ex-
planations provides an approach for studying the distribution of cultural features of ill-
ness across settings and regions, and over time. It also suggests qu estions about cultural
determinants of risk, course, and outcome in clinical and community settings to en-
hance the evidence base of cultural research",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,804
"DSM-5 includes information on cultural conc epts in order to improve the accuracy of
diagnosis and the comprehensiveness of clinical assessment. Clinical assessment of indi-
viduals presenting with thes e cultural concepts should determine whether they meet
DSM-5 criteria for a spec ified disorder or an other specified or unspecified  diagnosis. Once the
disorder is diagnosed, the cultural terms and explanations should be included in case for-
mulations; they may help clarify symptoms and etiological a ttributions that could other-
wise be confusing. Individuals whose sympto ms do not meet DSM criteria for a specific
mental disorder may still expect  and require treatment; this should be assessed on a case-
by-case basis. In addition to the CFI and its supplementary modules, DSM-5 contains the
following information and tools that may be useful when integrating cultural information
in clinical practice:
•Data in DSM-5 criteria and text for specific disorders:  The text includes information
on cultural variations in prevalence, sy mptomatology, associate d cultural concepts,
and other clinical aspects. It is important to emphasize that there is no one-to-one cor-
respondence at the categorical level between  DSM disorders and cultural concepts. Dif-
ferential diagnosis for individuals must th erefore incorporate in formation on cultural
variation with information elicited by the CFI",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,804
"•Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention: Some of the clinical con-
cerns identified by the CFI may correspond to V codes or Z code s—for example, accul-
turation problems, parent-child relational pr oblems, or religious or spiritual problems",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,804
"•Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress:  Located in the Appendix, this glossary pro-
vides examples of well-studied cultural concepts of distress  that illustrate the relevance
of cultural information for c linical diagnosis and s ome of the interrelationships among
cultural syndromes, idioms of di stress, and causal explanations.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,804
"761Alternative DSM-5 Model for
Personality Disorders
The current approach  to personality disorders appe ars in Section II of DSM-5,
and an alternative model developed for DSM-5 is presented here in Section III. The inclu-
sion of both models in DSM-5 reflects the de cision of the APA Board of Trustees to pre-
serve continuity with current clinical practi ce, while also introducing a new approach that
aims to address numerous shor tcomings of the current approa ch to personality disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,806
"For example, the typical patient meeting criter ia for a specific personality disorder fre-
quently also meets criteria for other personalit y disorders. Similarly, other specified or un-
specified personality disorder is  often the correct (but mostly  uninformative) diagnosis, in
the sense that patients do not tend to present with patterns of symptoms that correspond
with one and only one personality disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,806

impairments in personality functioning  and pathological personality traits.  The specific

"Criteria C and D: Perv asiveness and Stability
Impairments in personality functioning an d pathological pers onality traits are relatively  per-
vasive across a range of personal and social contexts, as personality is defined as a pattern of
perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environm ent and oneself. The term relatively
reflects the fact that all except the most extr emely pathological personalities show some de-
gree of adaptability. The pattern in personality disorders is maladaptive and relatively inflex-
ible, which leads to disabilities in social, o ccupational, or other important pursuits, as
individuals are unable to modify their thinking or behavior, even in th e face of evidence that
their approach is not working. The impairments in functioning and personality traits are also
relatively  stable. Personality traits—the dispositions  to behave or feel in certain ways—are
more stable than the symptomatic expressions of  these dispositions, but personality traits can
also change. Impairments in personality fu nctioning are more stable than symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,808
"Criteria E, F, and G: Al ternative Explanations for 
Personality Pathology (D ifferential Diagnosis)
On some occasions, what appears to be a pe rsonality disorder may be better explained by
another mental disorder, the effects of a subs tance or another medica l condition, or a nor-
mal developmental stage (e.g., adolescence, late  life) or the individu al’s sociocultural en-
vironment. When another ment al disorder is present, the diagnosis of a personality
disorder is not made, if the manifestations of  the personality disorder clearly are an ex-
pression of the other mental disorder (e.g., if  features of schizotypal personality disorder
are present only in the context of schizophren ia). On the other hand, personality disorders
can be accurately diagnosed in the presence of  another mental disord er, such as major de-
pressive disorder, and patients with other me ntal disorders should be assessed for comor-
bid personality disorders because personality disorders often impact the course of other
mental disorders. Therefore, it is always appropriate to assess personality functioning and

disorders, and to maximize relationships with functional impairment. The resulting diag-
nostic criteria sets represent clinically usef ul personality disorders with high fidelity, in
terms of core impairments in personality functioning of varying degr ees of severity and
constellations of pathological personality traits",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,816
"Personality Disorder Diagnosis
Individuals who have a pattern of impairment  in personality functioning and maladaptive
traits that matches one of the six defined personality disorders should be diagnosed with
that personality disorder. If an individual also  has one or even several prominent traits that
may have clinical relevance in addition to those requ ired for the diagnosis (e.g., see narcis-
sistic personality disorder), the option exists for these to be noted as specifiers. Individuals
whose personality functioning or trait pattern is substantially different from that of any of
the six specific personality disorders should be diagnosed with PD-T S. The individual may
not meet the required number of A or B criter ia and, thus, have a su bthreshold presentation
of a personality disorder. The individual may have a mix of features of personality disorder
types or some features that are less characteri stic of a type and more accurately considered
a mixed or atypical presentation. The specific level of impairment in personality function-
ing and the pathological personality traits that characterize the individual’s personality can
be specified for PD-TS, using the Level of Personality Functioning Scale (Table 2) and the
pathological trait taxonomy (T able 3). The current diagnoses of paranoid, schizoid, histri-
onic, and dependent personality disorders are represented also by the diagnosis of PD-TS;
these are defined by moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning and can be
specified by the relevant pathological personality trait combinations",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,816
"Level of Personality Functioning
Like most human tendencies, personality func tioning is distributed on a continuum. Cen-
tral to functioning and adaptation are indivi duals’ characteristic ways of thinking about
and understanding themselves and their intera ctions with others. An optimally function-
ing individual has a complex, fully elaborat ed, and well-integrated psychological world
that includes a mostly positive,  volitional, and adaptive self-concept; a rich, broad, and ap-
propriately regulated emotional life; and the ca pacity to behave as a productive member of
society with reciprocal and fulfilling interper sonal relationships. At the opposite end of
the continuum, an individual with severe personality pathology has an impoverished, dis-
organized, and/or conflicted psychological world that includes a weak, unclear, and mal-
adaptive self-concept; a propensity to negative, dysregulated emotions; and a deficient
capacity for adaptive interpersona l functioning and social behavior.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,816

impairment in ideas and feelin gs regarding self and interper sonal relationships; this no-
tion is consistent with multiple theories of personality disorder and their research bases. The
components of the Level of Personality Func tioning Scale—identity, self-direction, empa-
thy, and intimacy (see Table 1)—are particularly  central in describing a personality func-
tioning continuum",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,817
"Mental representations of the self and interpersonal relationships are reciprocally in-
fluential and inextricably tied , affect the nature of interaction with mental health pro-
fessionals, and can have a significant impact  on both treatment efficacy and outcome,
underscoring the importance of assessing an individual’s characteristic self-concept as
well as views of other people and relationships. Although the degree of disturbance in the
self and interpersonal functioning is continuous ly distributed, it is useful to consider the
level of impairment in functioning for clinical characterization and for treatment planning
and prognosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,817
"Rating Level of Pers onality Functioning
To use the Level of Personality Functioning Sc ale (LPFS), the clinician selects the level that
most closely captures  the individual’s current overall  level of impairment in personality func-
tioning. The rating is necessary for the diagnosi s of a personality disord er (moderate or greater
impairment) and can be used to specify the seve rity of impairment pr esent for an individual
with any personality disorder at  a given point in time. The LPFS may also be used as a global
indicator of personality functi oning without specification of a personality disorder diagnosis,
or in the event that personality impairment  is subthreshold for a disorder diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,817
"Personality Traits
Definition and Description
Criterion B in the alternative model involves assessments of personality traits that are
grouped into five domains. A personality trait is a tendency to feel, perceive, behave, and
think in relatively consistent ways across time  and across situations in which the trait may
manifest. For example, individuals with a high level of the personality trait of anxiousness
would tend to feel anxious readily, including in circumstances in which most people
would be calm and relaxed.  Individuals high in trait anxiousness also would perceive  sit-
uations to be anxiety-provoking more freque ntly than would individuals with lower lev-
els of this trait, and those high in the trait would tend to behave  so as to avoid situations that
they think  would make them anxious. They would thereby tend to think  about the world as
more anxiety provoking than other people",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,817
"Importantly, individuals high in trait anxiousness would not nece ssarily be anxious at
all times and in all situations. Individuals’ trait levels also can and do change throughout
life. Some changes are very general and reflect maturation (e.g., teenagers generally are
higher on trait impulsivity than are older ad ults), whereas other ch anges reflect individ-
uals’ life experiences",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,817
"Dimensionality of personality traits. All individuals can be located on the spectrum of
trait dimensions; that is, personality traits apply to everyone in different degrees rather",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,817
"Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders 773
than being present versus absent. Moreover, personality traits, including those identified
specifically in the Section III model, exist on a spectrum with two opposing poles. For ex-
ample, the opposite of the trait of callousness is the tendency to be empathic and kind-
hearted, even in circumstances in which most persons would not feel that way. Hence, al-
though in Section III th is trait is labeled callousness, because that pole of the dimension is
the primary focus, it coul d be described in full as callousness versus kind-heartedness.  More-
over, its opposite pole can be  recognized and may not be adaptive in all circumstances
(e.g., individuals who, due to extreme kind-heartedness, repeatedly allow themselves to
be taken advantage of by unscrupulous others)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,818
"Hierarchical structure of personality. Some trait terms are quite specific (e.g., “talkative”)
and describe a narrow range of behaviors, wh ereas others are quite broad (e.g., Detach-
ment) and characterize a wide range of beha vioral propensities. Broad trait dimensions
are called domains, and specific trait dimensions are called facets.  Personality trait domains
comprise a spectrum of more specific personality facets  that tend to occur together. For ex-
ample, withdrawal and anhedonia are specific trait facets  in the trait domain  of Detachment",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,818
"Despite some cross-cultural variation in pe rsonality trait facets, the broad domains they
collectively comprise are relati vely consistent across cultures",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,818
"The Personality Trait Model
The Section III personality trait system includ es five broad domains of personality trait
variation—Negative Affectivity (vs. Emotiona l Stability), Detachment (vs. Extraversion),
Antagonism (vs. Agreeableness), Disinhibition  (vs. Conscientiousness), and Psychoticism
(vs. Lucidity)—comprising 25 specific personalit y trait facets. Table 3 provides definitions
of all personality domains and facets. These five broad domains are maladaptive variants
of the five domains of the extensively valid ated and replicated personality model known
as the “Big Five”, or Five Factor Model of pe rsonality (FFM), and are also similar to the do-
mains of the Personality Psychopathology Five (PSY-5). The specific 25 facets represent a
list of personality facets chosen for their clinical relevance",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,818
"Although the Trait Model focuses on persona lity traits associated with psychopathol-
ogy, there are healthy, adaptive, and resilien t personality traits identified as the polar
opposites of these traits, as noted in the pa rentheses above (i.e., Em otional Stability, Ex-
traversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Lucidity). Their presence can greatly
mitigate the effects of mental disorders and facilitate coping and re covery from traumatic
injuries and other medical illness",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,818
"Distinguishing Traits, Symptoms, and Specific Behaviors
Although traits are by no means immutable and do change throughout the life span, they
show relative consistency compared with sy mptoms and specific behaviors. For example,
a person may behave impulsively at a specific ti me for a specific reason (e.g., a person who
is rarely impulsive suddenly decides to spend a great deal of money on a particular item
because of an unusual opportunity to purchase  something of unique value), but it is only
when behaviors aggregate across time and circumstance, such that a pattern of behavior
distinguishes between individuals, that they re flect traits. Nevertheless, it is important to
recognize, for example,  that even people wh o are impulsive are not acting impulsively all
of the time. A trait is a tendency or dispositio n toward specific behaviors; a specific behav-
ior is an instance or manifestation of a trait",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,818
"Similarly, traits are distin guished from most symptoms  because symptoms tend to
wax and wane, whereas traits are relatively more stable. For example, individuals with
higher levels of depressivity  have a greater likelihood of experiencing discrete episodes of a
depressive disorder and of showing the sympto ms of these disorders, such difficulty con-
centrating. However, even patients  who have a trait propensity to depressivity  typically cy-
cle through distinguishable episodes of mood disturbance, and specific symptoms such as",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,818
"774 Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders
difficulty concentrating tend to wax and wane in  concert with specific episodes, so they do
not form part of the trait definition. Import antly, however, symptoms and traits are both
amenable to intervention, and many interven tions targeted at symptoms can affect the
longer term patterns of pers onality functioning that are ca ptured by personality traits",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,819
"Assessment of the DSM-5 Section III 
Personality Trait Model
The clinical utility of the Section III multidimensio nal personality trait model lies in its ability
to focus attention on multiple relevant areas of personality variation in each individual patient",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,819
"Rather than focusing attention on the identification of one and only one optimal diagnostic
label, clinical ap plication of the Section III personality trait model involves reviewing all five
broad personality domains portrayed in Table 3. The clinical approach to personality is similar
to the well-known review of systems in clinical medicine. For example, an individual’s pre-
senting complaint may focus on a specific ne urological symptom, yet during an initial
evaluation clinicians still systematically review  functioning in all relevant systems (e.g., car-
diovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal), lest  an important area of diminished functioning
and corresponding opportunity for effective intervention be missed",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,819
"Clinical use of the Section III personality trait model proceeds similarly. An initial in-
quiry reviews all five broad doma ins of personality. This systematic review is facilitated
by the use of formal psychome tric instruments designed to me asure specific facets and do-
mains of personality. For example, the person ality trait model is operationalized in the
Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5), which can be completed in its self-report form by
patients and in its informant-report form by those who know the patient well (e.g., a
spouse). A detailed clinical assessment would involve collect ion of both patient- and in-
formant-report data on all 25 facets of the pe rsonality trait model. However, if this is not
possible, due to time or other co nstraints, assessment focused at the five-domain level is an
acceptable clinical option when only a general (vs. detailed) portrait of a patient’s person-
ality is needed (see Criterion B of PD-TS). Ho wever, if personality- based problems are the
focus of treatment, then it will be important to assess individual s’ trait facets as well as do-
mains",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,819
"Because personality traits are continuously distributed in the population, an approach
to making the judgment that a specific trait is elevated (and therefor e is present for diag-
nostic purposes) could involve comparing indi viduals’ personality tr ait levels with pop-
ulation norms and/or clinical judgment. If a trait is elevated—that is, formal psychometric
testing and/or interview data support the clinical judgment of elevation—then it is con-
sidered as contributing to meeting Criterion B of Section III personality disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,819
"Clinical Utility of the Multidimensional Personality 
Functioning a nd Trait Model
Disorder and trait constructs each add value to the other in  predicting important anteced-
ent (e.g., family history, hist ory of child abuse), concurrent (e.g., functional impairment,
medication use), and predictive (e.g., hospit alization, suicide attempts) variables. DSM-5
impairments in personality functioning and pa thological personality traits each contrib-
ute independently to clinical decisions about degree of disability; risks for self-harm, vio-
lence, and criminality; reco mmended treatment type and intensity; and prognosis—all
important aspects of the utility of psychiatric diagnoses. Notably, knowing the level of an
individual’s personality functioning and his or  her pathological trait profile also provides
the clinician with a rich base of information and is valuable in treatment planning and in
predicting the course and outcome of many me ntal disorders in addition to personality
disorders. Therefore, assessment of persona lity functioning and pathological personality
traits may be relevant whether an indivi dual has a personality disorder or not.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,819

Attenuated psychotic symptoms, as defined in Criterion A, are psychosis-like but below the
threshold for a full psychotic disorder. Comp ared with psychotic disorders, the symptoms
are less severe and more transient, and insight is relatively maintained . A diagnosis of atten-
uated psychosis syndrome requires state psychopathology associated with functional
impairment rather than long-standing trait pathology. The psychopathology has not pro-
gressed to full psychotic severi ty. Attenuated psychosis syndrome is a disorder based on the
manifest pathology and impaired function and distress. Changes in experiences and behav-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,828

iors are noted by the individual  and/or others, suggesting a change in mental state (i.e., the
symptoms are of sufficient severi ty or frequency to warrant clin ical attention) (Criterion A)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,829
"Attenuated delusions (Criterion  A1) may have suspiciousness /persecutory ideational con-
tent, including persecutory ideas of reference. The individual may have a guarded, distrust-
ful attitude. When the delusions are moderate in severity, the individual views others as
untrustworthy and may be hyperv igilant or sense ill will in others. When the delusions are
severe but still within the attenuated range, the individual entertains  loosely organized be-
liefs about danger or hostile in tention, but the delusions do no t have the fixed nature that is
necessary for the diagnosis of a psychotic diso rder. Guarded behavior in the interview can
interfere with the ability to gath er information. Rea lity testing and perspective can be elic-
ited with nonconfirming evidence, but the prop ensity for viewing the world as hostile and
dangerous remains strong. Attenuated delusions may have grandiose content presenting as
an unrealistic sense of superior capacity. Wh en the delusions are moderate, the individual
harbors notions of being gifted, influential, or special. When the delusions are severe, the in-
dividual has beliefs of superiority that often alienate friends and worry relatives. Thoughts
of being special may lead to unrealistic plans and investments, yet skepticism about these at-
titudes can be elicited with persis tent questioning and confrontation",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,829
"Attenuated hallucinations (Criterion A2) include alterations in sensory perceptions,
usually auditory and/or visual. When the hallucinations are moderate, the sounds and
images are often unformed (e.g ., shadows, trails, halos, mu rmurs, rumbling), and they are
experienced as unusual or puzzling. When the hallucinations are severe, these experiences
become more vivid and frequent (i.e., recurring illusions or hallucinations that capture at-
tention and affect thinking and concentratio n). These perceptual abnormalities may dis-
rupt behavior, but skepticism about their reality can still be induced. 
Disorganized communica tion (Criterion A3) may manifest as odd speech (vague, meta-
phorical, overelaborate, stereoty ped), unfocused speech (confuse d, muddled, too fast or too
slow, wrong words, irrelevant context, off trac k), or meandering speech (circumstantial, tan-
gential). When the disorganization is moderately  severe, the individual frequently gets into
irrelevant topics but re sponds easily to clarifying questi ons. Speech may be odd but under-
standable. At the moderately severe level, speech becomes meandering and circumstantial,
and when the disorganization is severe, the in dividual fails to get to the point without
external guidance (tangential). At the severe level, some thought blocking and/or loose as-
sociations may occur infrequently, especially wh en the individual is under pressure, but re-
orienting questions quickly re turn structure and organiza tion to the conversation. 
The individual realizes that changes in mental state and/or in relationships are taking
place. He or she maintains reasonable insigh t into the psychotic-like experiences and gen-
erally appreciates that altered perceptions are not real and magical ideation is not compel-
ling. The individual must experience distress and/or impaired performance in social or role
functioning (Criterion D), and the individual or responsible others must note the changes
and express concern, such that clinic al care is sought (Criterion A)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,829
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
The individual may experience magical thinking, perceptual aberrations, difficulty in con-
centration, some disorganization in thought or behavior, excessive suspiciousness, anxi-
ety, social withdrawal, and disruption in sl eep-wake cycle. Impaired cognitive function
and negative symptoms are often observed. Neuroimaging variables distinguish cohorts
with attenuated psychosis syndro me from normal control coho rts with patterns similar to,

"Development and Course
Onset of attenuated psychosis syndrome is usually in mid-to-late adolescence or early
adulthood. It may be preceded by normal development or evidence for impaired cogni-
tion, negative symptoms, and/or impaired so cial development. In help-seeking cohorts,
approximately 18% in 1 year and 32% in 3 years may progress symptomatically and met
criteria for a psychotic disorder . In some cases, the syndrome may transition to a depres-
sive or bipolar disorder with psychotic featur es, but development to a schizophrenia spec-
trum disorder is more frequent. It appears that the diagnosis is  best applied to individuals
ages 15–35 years. Long-term course is not yet describe d beyond 7–12 years",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,830

testing/insight remains intact. 
Schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder, although having
symptomatic features that are similar to thos e of attenuated psychosis syndrome, is a rel-
atively stable trait disorder not meeting the st ate-dependent aspects (Criterion C) of atten-

Diagnostic Features
Individuals with short-durati on hypomania have experienced at least one major depres-
sive episode as well as at least two episodes of 2–3 days’ duration  in which criteria for a hy-
pomanic episode were met (except for symptom duration). These episodes are of sufficient
intensity to be categorized as a hypomanic ep isode but do not meet the 4-day duration re-
quirement. Symptoms are present to a signific ant degree, such that they represent a no-
ticeable change from the individual’s normal behavior",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,833

sive episode by definition has bipolar II disord er, regardless of current duration of hypo-
manic symptoms",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,833
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Individuals who have experienced both shor t-duration hypomania and a major depres-
sive episode, with their increased comorbidit y with substance use disorders and a greater
family history of bipolar diso rder, more closely resemble in dividuals with bipolar disor-
der than those with major depressive disorder. 
Differences have also been found between individuals with short-duration hypomania
and those with syndromal bipolar disorder. Work impairment was greater for individuals
with syndromal bipolar disorder, as was the es timated average number of episodes. Indi-
viduals with short-duration hypomania may exhibit less se verity than individuals with
syndromal hypomanic episodes, including less mood lability",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,833
"Prevalence
The prevalence of short-duration hypomania is un clear, since the criteria are new as of this
edition of the manual. Using somewhat different  criteria, however, it has been estimated
that short-duration hypomania occurs in 2.8%  of the population (compared with hypoma-
nia or mania in 5.5% of the population). Short-duration hypomani a may be more common
in females, who may present with more  features of atypical depression. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors
Genetic and physiological. A family history of mania is two to three times more common in
individuals with short-duration hypomania co mpared with the general population, but less
than half as common as in individuals with  a history of syndromal mania or hypomania",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,833

healthy individuals, although not as high as the rates in individuals with syndromal bipo-
lar disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,833
"Functional Consequences of Short-Duration Hypomania
Functional impairments associated specifically  with short-duration hypomania are as yet
not fully determined. However, research suggests that individuals with this disorder have
less work impairment than individuals with  syndromal bipolar disorder but more comor-
bid substance use disorders, particularly alco hol use disorder, than individuals with major
depressive disorder.

hypomanic symptoms, whereas short-duration hypomania is characterized by periods of",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,833
"Conditions for Further Study 789
2–3 days of hypomanic symptoms. Once an individual has experienced a hypomanic ep-
isode (4 days or more), the diagnosis beco mes and remains bipolar II disorder regardless
of future duration of hy pomanic symptom periods. 
Major depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder is al so characterized by at least
one lifetime major depressive ep isode. However, the additional presence of at least two life-
time periods of 2–3 days of hypomanic symptoms leads to a diagnosis of short-duration hy-
pomania rather than to major depressive disorder.  
Major depressive disorder with mixed features. Both major depressive disorder with
mixed features and short-duration hypomania are characterized by the presence of some
hypomanic symptoms and a major depressive episode. However, major depressive disor-
der with mixed features is characteri zed by hypomanic features present concurrently  with
a major depressive episode, while individual s with short-duration hypomania experience
subsyndromal hypomania and fully syndroma l major depression at different times",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,834
"Bipolar I disorder. Bipolar I disorder is differentiat ed from short-duration hypomania
by at least one lifetime manic episode, which is longer (at least 1 week) and more severe
(causes more impaired social functioning) than a hypomanic episode. An episode (of any
duration) that involves psychotic symptoms or necessitates hospitalization is by definition
a manic episode rather than a hypomanic one",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,834

"Diagnostic Features 
Persistent complex bereavement disorder is diagnosed only if at least 12 months (6 months
in children) have elapsed since the death of someone with whom the bereaved had a close
relationship (Criterion A). This time fram e discriminates normal grief from persistent
grief. The condition typically involves a pe rsistent yearning/longing for the deceased
(Criterion B1), which may be associated with  intense sorrow and frequent crying (Crite-
rion B2) or preoccupation with  the deceased (Criterion B3).  The individual may also be
preoccupied with the manner in which the person died (Criterion B4). 
Six additional symptoms are required, includ ing marked difficulty accepting that the in-
dividual has died (Criterion C1) (e.g. preparing meals for them), disbelief that the individual is
dead (Criterion C2), distressing memories of the deceased (Criterion C3), anger over the loss
(Criterion C4), maladaptive appraisals about oneself in relation to the deceased or the death
(Criterion C5), and excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss  (Criterion C6). Individuals
may also report a desire to die because they wish to be with the deceased (Criterion C7); be dis-
trustful of others (Criterion C8);  feel isolated (Criterion C9); believe that life has no meaning or
purpose without the deceased (C riterion C10); experience a di minished sense of identity in
which they feel a part of themselves has died or been lost (Criterion C11); or have difficulty en-
gaging in activities, pursuing relationships, or planning for the future (Criterion C12). ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,835
"Conditions for Further Study 791
Persistent complex bereavement disorder requires clinically significant distress or im-
pairment in psychosocial functioning (Criteri on D). The nature and severity of grief must
be beyond expected norms for the relevant cu ltural setting, religio us group, or develop-
mental stage (Criterion E). Although there are variations in  how grief can manifest, the
symptoms of persistent complex bereavement disorder occur in both genders and in di-
verse social and cultural groups",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,836
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis 
Some individuals with persistent complex bereavement disorder experience hallucina-
tions of the deceased (auditory or visual) in which they temporarily perceive the deceased’s
presence (e.g., seeing the deceased sitting in his or her favorite chai r). They may also ex-
perience diverse somatic complaints (e.g., digestive complaints, pain, fatigue), including
symptoms experienced by the deceased. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of persistent complex bere avement disorder is approximately 2.4%–4.8%",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,836
The disorder is more prevalent in females than in males,Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,836
"Development and Course 
Persistent complex bereavement disorder can o ccur at any age, beginning after the age of
1 year. Symptoms usually begin within the initial months af ter the death, although there
may be a delay of months, or even years, before the full syndrome a ppears. Although grief
responses commonly appear immediately following bereavemen t, these reactions are not
diagnosed as persistent comp lex bereavement disorder unless the symptoms persist be-
yond 12 months (6 months for children). 
Young children may experience the loss of a primary caregiver as traumatic, given the
disorganizing effects the caregiver’s absence ca n have on a child’s coping response. In chil-
dren, the distress may be expressed in play and behavior, developmental regressions, and
anxious or protest behavior at times of separation and reunion. Separation distress may be
predominant in younger children, and social/i dentity distress and risk for comorbid de-
pression can increasingly manifest in older children and adolescents",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,836

"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues 
The symptoms of persistent complex bereav ement disorder are observed across cultural
settings, but grief responses may manifest in cu lturally specific ways. Diagnosis of the dis-
order requires that the persistent and severe responses go beyond cultural norms of grief

ideation.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,836
"792 Conditions for Further Study
Functional Consequences of 
Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder
Persistent complex bereavement di sorder is associated with deficits in work and social func-
tioning and with harmful health behaviors, such as increased tobacco and alcohol use. It is also
associated with marked increases in risks for serious medical conditions, including cardiac dis-
ease, hypertension, cancer, immunological deficiency, and reduced quality of life. 
Differential Diagnosis
Normal grief. Persistent complex bereavement diso rder is distinguished from normal
grief by the presence of severe grief reactions that persist at least 12 months (or 6 months in
children) after the death of the bereaved. It is only when severe levels of grief response per-
sist at least 12 months following the death an d interfere with the in dividual’s capacity to
function that persisten t complex bereavement disorder is diagnosed. 
Depressive disorders. Persistent complex bereavement disorder, major depressive dis-
order, and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) share sadness, crying, and suicidal
thinking. Whereas major depressi ve disorder and persistent de pressive disorder can share
depressed mood with persistent complex bereavement disorder, the latter is characterized
by a focus on the loss. 
Posttraumatic stress disorder. Individuals who experience bereavement as a result of trau-
matic death may develop both posttraumatic stre ss disorder (PTSD) and persistent complex
bereavement disorder. Both conditions ca n involve intrusive th oughts and avoidance",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,837
"Whereas intrusions in PTSD revolve around the traumatic event, intrusive memories in per-
sistent complex bereavement diso rder focus on thoughts about many aspects of the relation-
ship with the deceased, including positive asp ects of the relationship and distress over the
separation. In individuals with the traumatic be reavement specifier of persistent complex be-
reavement disorder, the distressin g thoughts or feelings may be more overtly related to the
manner of death, with distressing fantasies of  what happened. Both persistent complex be-
reavement disorder and PTSD can involve avoi dance of reminders of distressing events",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,837
"Whereas avoidance in PTSD is characterized by  consistent avoidance of  internal and external
reminders of the traumatic experience, in persistent complex bereavement disorder, there is
also a preoccupation with the loss and yearning  for the deceased, which is absent in PTSD. 
Separation anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by anxiety
about separation from current attachment figures, whereas persistent complex bereavement
disorder involves distress about separation from a deceased individual. 
Comorbidity  
The most common comorbid disorders with pe rsistent complex bere avement disorder are
major depressive disorder, PT SD, and substance use disorders. PTSD is more frequently
comorbid with persistent complex bereavement disorder when the deat h occurred in trau-
matic or violent circumstances",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,837

"A diagnosis of substance dependence due to caffeine is recognized by the World Health
Organization in ICD-10. Since the publication of DSM-IV in 1994, considerable research on
caffeine dependence has been published, an d several recent reviews provide a current
analysis of this literature. There is now sufficie nt evidence to warran t inclusion of caffeine
use disorder as a research diagnosis in DSM-5 to encourage additional research. The work-
ing diagnostic algorithm propos ed for the study of caffeine use disorder differs from that
of the other substance use disorders, reflecting  the need to identify only cases that have
sufficient clinical importance to warrant the la beling of a mental disorder. A key goal of in-
cluding caffeine use disorder in  this section of DSM-5 is to stimulate research that will
determine the reliability, validity, and preval ence of caffeine use disorder based on the
proposed diagnostic schema, with particular attention to the association of the diagnosis
with functional impairments as part of validity testing. 
The proposed criteria for caff eine use disorder reflect the need for a diagnostic thresh-
old higher than that used for the other subs tance use disorders. Such a threshold is in-
tended to prevent overdiagnosis of caffeine us e disorder due to the high rate of habitual
nonproblematic daily caffeine use in the general population. 
Diagnostic Features
Caffeine use disorder is characterized by the continued use of caffeine and failure to con-
trol use despite negative physical and/or psyc hological consequences. In a survey of the
general population, 14% of caffeine users met the criterion of use despite harm, with most
reporting that a physician or counselor had advised them to stop or reduce caffeine use
within the last year. Medical and psychological problems attributed to caffeine included
heart, stomach, and urinary problems, and co mplaints of anxiety, depression, insomnia,
irritability, and difficulty thinking. In the sam e survey, 45% of caffei ne users reported de-
sire or unsuccessful efforts to control caffeine use, 18% repo rted withdrawal, 8% reported
tolerance, 28% used more than intended, and 50% reported spending a great deal of time
using caffeine. In addition, 19% reported a strong desire for caffeine that they could not re-
sist, and less than 1% reported that caffein e had interfered with social activities. 
Among those seeking treatment for quitting  problematic caffeine use, 88% reported
having made prior serious attempts to modify  caffeine use, and 43% reported having been
advised by a medical professional to reduce or eliminate caffeine. Ninety-three percent
endorsed signs and symptoms meeting DSM-IV criteria for caffeine dependence, with the",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,838

most commonly endorsed criteria being withdr awal (96%), persistent desire or unsuccess-
ful efforts to control use (89%), and use de spite knowledge of physical or psychological
problems caused by caffeine (87%). The most  common reasons for wanting to modify caf-
feine use were health-related (59%) and a desire to not be dependent on caffeine (35%)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,839
"The DSM-5 discussion of ca ffeine withdrawal in the Section II chapter “Substance-
Related and Addictive Disorders” provides info rmation on the features of the withdrawal
criterion. It is well documented  that habitual caffeine users can experience a well-defined
withdrawal syndrome upon ac ute abstinence from caffeine, and many caffeine-dependent
individuals report continued use of caffeine to avoid experiencing withdrawal symptoms. 
Prevalence
The prevalence of caffeine use di sorder in the general population is unclear. Based on all
seven generic DSM-IV-TR criteria for dependence, 30% of current caffeine users may have
met DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of caffei ne dependence, with endorsement of three or
more dependence criteria, during the past year . When only four of the seven criteria (the
three primary criteria proposed above plus to lerance) are used, the prevalence appears to
drop to 9%. Thus, the expected prevalence of caffeine use disorder among regular caffeine
users is likely less than 9%. Given that approximately 75%–80% of the general population
uses caffeine regularly, the estimated preval ence would be less than 7%. Among regular
caffeine drinkers at higher risk for caffeine use problems (e.g., high school and college stu-
dents, individuals in drug treatment, and indi viduals at pain clinics who have recent his-
tories of alcohol or illicit drug misuse), ap proximately 20% may have a pattern of use that
meets all three of the proposed criteria in Criterion A",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,839
"Development and Course
Individuals whose patter n of use meets criteria for a ca ffeine use disorder have shown a
wide range of daily caffeine intake and have been consumer s of various types of caffein-
ated products (e.g., coffee, soft drinks, tea)  and medications. A diagnosis of caffeine use
disorder has been shown to prospectively pred ict a greater incidence of caffeine reinforce-
ment and more severe withdrawal",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,839
"There has been no longitudinal or cross-sect ional lifespan research on caffeine use dis-
order. Caffeine use disorder has been identi fied in both adolescents and adults. Rates of
caffeine consumption and overa ll level of caffeine consumption tend to increase with age
until the early to mid-30s and then level off.  Age-related factors for caffeine use disorder
are unknown, although concern is growing related to excessive caffeine consumption
among adolescents and young adults through use of caffeinated energy drinks. 
Risk and Prognostic Factors 
Genetic and physiological. Heritabilities of heavy caffeine use, caffeine tolerance, and
caffeine withdrawal range from  35% to 77%. For caffeine use, alcohol use, and cigarette
smoking, a common genetic factor (polysubst ance use) underlies the use of these three
substances, with 28%–41% of the heritable e ffects of caffeine use (or heavy use) shared
with alcohol and smoking. Caffeine and toba cco use disorders are associated and substan-
tially influenced by genetic factors unique to these licit drugs. The magnitude of heritabil-
ity for caffeine use disorder ma rkers appears to be similar to that for alcohol and tobacco
use disorder markers",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,839

pairment in normal daily activities. Caffeine intoxication may include symptoms of
nausea and vomiting, as well as impairment of normal activities. Significant disruptions in
normal daily activities may occur during caffeine abstinence. 
Differential Diagnosis
Nonproblematic use of caffeine. The distinction between nonproblematic use of caf-
feine and caffeine use disorder can be difficul t to make because social, behavioral, or psy-
chological problems may be difficult to attribut e to the substance, espe cially in the context of
use of other substances. Regular,  heavy caffeine use that can result in tolerance and with-
drawal is relatively common, which by itself sh ould not be sufficient for making a diagnosis. 
Other stimulant use disorder. Problems related to use of other stimulant medications
or substances may approximate the fe atures of caffeine use disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,840
"Anxiety disorders. Chronic heavy caffeine use may mimi c generalized anxiety disorder,
and acute caffeine cons umption may produce and mimic panic attacks.

family or personal history of alcohol use diso rder. Features of caffeine use disorder (e.g.,
tolerance, caffeine withdrawal) may be positive ly associated with several diagnoses: ma-

activities that include a significant aspect of social interactions during play. Team aspects
appear to be a key motivation. Attempts to di rect the individual toward schoolwork or in-

"Alcohol is a neurobehavioral te ratogen, and prenatal alcoho l exposure has teratogenic
effects on central nervous system (CNS ) development and subsequent function. Neurobe-
havioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure  (ND-PAE) is a new clarifying term,

sure to alcohol in utero. The current diagnost ic guidelines allow ND-PAE to be diagnosed
both in the absence and in the presence of th e physical effects of prenatal alcohol exposure
(e.g., facial dysmorphology required for a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,844
"Diagnostic Features
The essential features of ND-PAE are the mani festation of impairment in neurocognitive,
behavioral, and adaptive functioning associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Impair-
ment can be documented based on past diagnostic evaluation s (e.g., psychological or ed-
ucational assessments) or medical records, reports by the in dividual or informants, and/
or observation by a clinician",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,844
"A clinical diagnosis of fetal alcohol synd rome, including specific prenatal alcohol-
related facial dysmorphology and growth retardation, can be used as evidence of signifi-
cant levels of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although both animal and human studies have
documented adverse effects of lower levels of drinking, identifying how much prenatal
exposure is needed to sign ificantly impact neurodevelop mental outcome remains chal-
lenging. Data suggest that a history of more than minimal gestationa l exposure (e.g., more
than light drinking) prior to pregnancy reco gnition and/or following pregnancy recogni-
tion may be required. Light drinking is defined as 1–13 drinks per month during preg-
nancy with no more than 2 of these drinks co nsumed on any 1 drinking occasion. Identifying
a minimal threshold of drinking during preg nancy will require consideration of a variety
of factors known to affect exposure and/or interact to influence developmental outcomes,
including stage of prenatal development, gestational smoking, maternal and fetal genet-
ics, and maternal physical status (i.e., ag e, health, and certain obstetric problems). 
Symptoms of ND-PAE include marked impairment in global  intellectual performance
(IQ) or neurocognitive impair ments in any of the following areas: executive functioning,
learning, memory, and/or visual-spatial reasoning. Impairments in self-regulation are pres-
ent and may include impairment in mood or behavioral regulation, attention deficit, or
impairment in impulse control. Finally, impa irments in adaptive functioning include com-
munication deficits and impairment in soci al communication and interaction. Impairment
in daily living (self-help) skills and impairment in motor skills may be present.  As it may be
difficult to obtain an accurate assessment of the neurocogni tive abilities of very young chil-
dren, it is appropriate to defer a diagnosi s for children 3 years of age and younger",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,844
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
Associated features vary depending on age,  degree of alcohol exposure, and the individ-
ual’s environment. An individual can be diag nosed with this disorder regardless of socio-
economic or cultural background. However, ongoing parental alcohol/substance misuse,
parental mental illness, exposure to domest ic or community violen ce, neglect or abuse,
disrupted caregiving relationships, multiple out-of-home placements, and lack of conti-
nuity in medical or mental health care are often present. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,844
"800 Conditions for Further Study
Prevalence
The prevalence rates of ND-PAE are unknown. However, estimated prevalence rates of clini-
cal conditions associated with prenatal alco hol exposure are 2%–5% in the United States. 
Development and Course
Among individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure, evidence of CNS dysfunction varies
according to developmental stage. Although about one-half of young children prenatally
exposed to alcohol show marked  developmental delay in the first 3 years of life, other chil-
dren affected by prenatal alcohol exposure may not exhibit signs of CNS dysfunction until
they are preschool- or school-age. Additionally, impairments in higher order cognitive
processes (i.e., executive functioning), which are often associated with  prenatal alcohol ex-
posure, may be more easily assessed in older children. When children reach school age,
learning difficulties, impairme nt in executive function, and problems with integrative lan-
guage functions usually emerge more clearly, and both social skills deficits and challeng-
ing behavior may become more evident. In particular, as school and other requirements
become more complex, greater deficits are no ted. Because of this, the school years repre-
sent the ages at which a diagnosis of ND-PAE would be most likely. 
Suicide Risk
Suicide is a high-risk outcome, with rates incr easing significantly in late adolescence and
early adulthood",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,845
"Functional Consequences of Neurobehavioral Disorder 
Associated With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure
The CNS dysfunction seen in individuals with ND-PAE often leads to decrements in adap-
tive behavior and to maladaptive behavior  with lifelong consequences. Individuals
affected by prenatal alcohol ex posure have a higher prevalence of disrupted school expe-
riences, poor employme nt records, trouble with the law,  confinement (legal or psychiat-
ric), and dependent living conditions. 
Differential Diagnosis
Disorders that are attributable to the physiolo gical effects associated with postnatal use
of a substance, another medical condition, or environmental neglect. Other consid-
erations include the physiological effects of po stnatal substance use, such as a medication,
alcohol, or other substances; disorders due to another medical condition, such as traumatic
brain injury or other neurocognitive disorder s (e.g., delirium, majo r neurocognitive dis-
order [dementia]); or environmental neglect",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,845
"Genetic and teratogenic conditions. Genetic conditions such as Williams syndrome,
Down syndrome, or Cornelia de Lange syndro me and other teratogeni c conditions such as
fetal hydantoin syndrome and maternal phen ylketonuria may have similar physical and
behavioral characteristics. A careful review of prenatal exposure history is needed to clar-
ify the teratogenic agent, and an evaluation by  a clinical geneticist may be needed to dis-
tinguish physical characteristics associated with these and other genetic conditions. 
Comorbidity
Mental health problems have been identified in more than 90% of individuals with histo-
ries of significant prenatal alcohol exposu re. The most common co-occurring diagnosis is
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bu t research has shown that individuals with
ND-PAE differ in neuropsychological charac teristics and in their responsiveness to phar-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,845

macological interventions. Ot her high- probability co-occurring disorders include oppo-
sitional defiant disorder and co nduct disorder, but the appropriateness of these diagnoses
should be weighed in the context of the sign ificant impairments in general intellectual and
executive functioning that are often associa ted with prenatal al cohol exposure. Mood
symptoms, including symptoms of bipolar diso rder and depressive disorders, have been
described. History of prenatal alcohol exposure  is associated with an increased risk for
later tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use disorders. 
Suicidal Behavior Disorder
Proposed Criteria 
A. Within the last 24 months, the individual has made a suicide attempt",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,846
"Note:  A suicide attempt is a self-initiated sequence of behaviors by an individual who,
at the time of initiation, expected that the set of actions would lead to his or her own
death. The “time of initiation” is the time when a behavior took place that involved ap-
plying the method.)
B. The act does not meet criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury—that is, it does not involve
self-injury directed to the surface of the body undertaken to induce relief from a nega-
tive feeling/cognitive state or to achieve a positive mood state",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,846
"C. The diagnosis is not applied to suic idal ideation or to preparatory acts. 
D. The act was not initiated during a state of delirium or confusion. 
E. The act was not undertaken solely for a political or religious objective. 
Specify if:
Current: Not more than 12 months since the last attempt",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,846
"Specifiers
Suicidal behavior is often categorized in term s of violence of the method. Generally, over-
doses with legal or illegal substances are cons idered nonviolent in method, whereas jump-
ing, gunshot wounds, and other methods are considered violent. Another dimension for
classification is medical consequences of the behavior, with high-lethality attempts being
defined as those requiring medical hospitalizat ion beyond a visit to an emergency depart-
ment. An additional dimension considered incl udes the degree of planning versus impul-
siveness of the attempt, a characteristic th at might have consequences for the medical
outcome of a suicide attempt",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,846
"If the suicidal behavior occurred 12–24 mo nths prior to evaluation, the condition is
considered to be in early remission. Individua ls remain at higher risk  for further suicide at-
tempts and death in the 24 months after a suicide attempt, and the period 12–24 months af-
ter the behavior took place is specified as “early remission.”
Diagnostic Features
The essential manifestation of suicidal be havior disorder is a suicide attempt. A suicide at-
tempt  is a behavior that the individual has undertak en with at least some intent to die. The
behavior might or might not le ad to injury or serious medi cal consequences. Several fac-
tors can influence the medical consequences of the suicide a ttempt, including poor plan-
ning, lack of knowledge about the lethality of the method chosen, low intentionality or
ambivalence, or chance intervention by others  after the behavior has been initiated. These
should not be considered in assigning the diagnosis.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,846
"802 Conditions for Further Study
Determining the degree of intent can be challenging. Individuals might not acknowl-
edge intent, especially in situations where doin g so could result in hospitalization or cause
distress to loved ones. Markers of risk includ e degree of planning, including selection of a
time and place to minimize rescue or interrupt ion; the individual’s mental state at the time
of the behavior, with acute agitation being especially concerning; recent discharge from
inpatient care; or recent discon tinuation of a mood stabilizer such as lithium or an anti-
psychotic such as clozapine in the case of schizophrenia. Examples of environmental “trig-
gers” include recently learning of a potentia lly fatal medical diagnosis such as cancer,
experiencing the sudden and unexpected loss of a close relative or partner, loss of employ-
ment, or displacement from h ousing. Conversely, features su ch as talking to others about
future events or preparedness to sign a contract for safety are less reliable indicators",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,847
"In order for the criteria to be met, the indivi dual must have made at least one suicide at-
tempt. Suicide attempts can incl ude behaviors in which, after initiating the suicide attempt,
the individual changed his or her mind or so meone intervened. For example, an individual
might intend to ingest a given amount of medication or pois on, but either stop or be stopped
by another before ingesting the full amount. If the individual is dissuaded by another or
changes his or her mind before initiating th e behavior, the diagnosis should not be made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,847
"The act must not meet criteria for nonsuicidal self-i njury—that is, it should not involve re-
peated (at least five times within the past 12 months) self-injurious episodes undertaken to
induce relief from a negative feeling/cognitive state or to achieve a positive mood state. The
act should not have been initiated during a st ate of delirium or confusion. If the individual
deliberately became intoxicated before initiating  the behavior, to reduce anticipatory anxi-
ety and to minimize interference with the inte nded behavior, the diagnosis should be made",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,847
"Development and Course
Suicidal behavior can occur at any time in the lifespan but is rarely seen in children under
the age of 5. In prepubertal children, the behavi or will often consist of a behavior (e.g., sit-
ting on a ledge) that a parent has forbidden because of the risk of accident. Approximately
25%–30% of persons who attempt suicide will go on to make more attempts.There is sig-
nificant variability in terms of frequency, me thod, and lethality of attempts. However, this
is not different from what is observed in other illnesses, such as major depressive disorder,
in which frequency of episode,  subtype of episode, and impa irment for a given episode can
vary significantly",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,847
"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues
Suicidal behavior varies in frequency and form  across cultures. Cultural differences might
be due to method availability (e.g., poisonin g with pesticides in developing countries;
gunshot wounds in the southwestern United St ates) or the presence of culturally specific
syndromes (e.g., ataques de nervios,  which in some Latino group s might lead to behaviors
that closely resemble suic ide attempts or might facilitate suicide attempts). 
Diagnostic Markers
Laboratory abnormalities consequent to the suicidal attempt are of ten evident. Suicidal
behavior that leads to blood loss can be a ccompanied by anemia, hypotension, or shock",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,847
"Overdoses might lead to coma or obtundatio n and associated laboratory abnormalities
such as electrolyte imbalances",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,847
"Functional Consequences of Suicidal Behavior Disorder

halation of vomit and suffocation, hepatic fa ilure consequent to use of paracetamol) can
occur as a consequence of suicidal behavior.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,847
"Conditions for Further Study 803
Comorbidity
Suicidal behavior is seen in th e context of a variety of mental disorders, most commonly bipo-
lar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizo phrenia, schizoaffective disorder, anxiety dis-
orders (in particular, panic disorders asso ciated with catastrophic content and PTSD
flashbacks), substance use disorders (especially  alcohol use disorders) , borderline personality
disorder, antisocial personality disorder, eating disorders, and adjustment disorders. It is
rarely manifested by individual s with no discernible pathology,  unless it is undertaken be-
cause of a painful medical condition with the in tention of drawing attention to martyrdom for
political or religious reasons, or in partners in  a suicide pact, both of which are excluded from
this diagnosis, or when third-party informants  wish to conceal the nature of the behavior. 
Nonsuicidal Self-Injury
Proposed Criteria
A. In the last year, the individual has, on 5 or more days, engaged in intentional self-inflicted
damage to the surface of his or her body of a sort likely to induce bleeding, bruising, or pain
(e.g., cutting, burning, stabbing, hitting, excessive rubbing), with the expectation that the
injury will lead to only minor or moderate physi cal harm (i.e., there is no suicidal intent). 
Note:  The absence of suicidal intent has either been stated by the individual or can be
inferred by the individual’s repeated engagement in a behavior that the individual
knows, or has learned, is not likely to result in death",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,848
"B. The individual engages in the self-injurious behavior with one or more of the following
expectations:
1. To obtain relief from a negative feeling or cognitive state",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,848
"Note:  The desired relief or response is experienced during or shortly after the self-
injury, and the individual may display patterns of behavior suggesting a dependence
on repeatedly engaging in it",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,848
"C. The intentional self-injury is associated with at least one of the following:
1. Interpersonal difficulties or negative feelings or thoughts, such as depression, anx-
iety, tension, anger, generalized distress, or self-criticism, occurring in the period
immediately prior to the self-injurious act",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,848
"2. Prior to engaging in the act, a period of preoccupation with the intended behavior
that is difficult to control",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,848
"3. Thinking about self-injury that occurs frequently, even when it is not acted upon",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,848
"D. The behavior is not socially sanctioned (e.g., body piercing, tattooing, part of a religious
or cultural ritual) and is not restricted to picking a scab or nail biting",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,848
"E. The behavior or its consequences cause clinically significant distress or interference in
interpersonal, academic, or other important areas of functioning",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,848
"F. The behavior does not occur exclusively during psychotic episodes, delirium, sub-
stance intoxication, or substance withdrawal. In individuals with a neurodevelopmental
disorder, the behavior is not part of a pattern of repetitive stereotypies. The behavior
is not better explained by another mental disorder or medical condition (e.g., psychotic
disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, ste-
reotypic movement disorder with self-injur y, trichotillomania [hair-pulling disorder], ex-
coriation [skin-picking] disorder).",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,848
"804 Conditions for Further Study
Diagnostic Features
The essential feature of nonsuicidal self-injur y is that the individual repeatedly inflicts
shallow, yet painful injuries to the surface of  his or her body. Most commonly, the purpose
is to reduce negative emotions, such as tensio n, anxiety, and self-reproach, and/or to re-
solve an interpersonal difficulty. In some cases, the injury is conceived of as a deserved
self-punishment. The individual will often report  an immediate sensation of relief that oc-
curs during the process. When the behavior o ccurs frequently, it mi ght be associated with
a sense of urgency and craving, the resultant behavioral pattern resembling an addiction",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,849
"The inflicted wounds can become deeper and more numerous. 
The injury is most often inflicted with a knif e, needle, razor, or other sharp object. Com-
mon areas for injury include the frontal area of the thighs and the dorsal side of the forearm",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,849
"A single session of injury might involve a se ries of superficial, parallel cuts—separated by
1 or 2 centimeters—on a visible or accessible location. The resulting cuts will often bleed and
will eventually leave a characteristic pattern of scars",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,849
"Other methods used include stabbing an area , most often the upper arm, with a needle
or sharp, pointed knife; inflicti ng a superficial burn with a lit cigarette end; or burning the
skin by repeated rubbing with an eraser. En gagement in nonsuicidal self-injury with mul-
tiple methods is associated with more severe  psychopathology, including engagement in
suicide attempts. 
The great majority of individuals who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury do not seek
clinical attention. It is not known if this re flects frequency of engagement in the disorder,
because accurate reporting is seen as stigma tizing, or because the behaviors are experi-
enced positively by the individual who engages in them, who is unmotivated to receive
treatment. Young children might experiment wi th these behaviors but not experience re-
lief. In such cases, youths often report that  the procedure is painful or distressing and
might then discontinue the practice",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,849
"Development and Course
Nonsuicidal self-injury most often starts in the early teen years and can continue for many
years. Admission to hospital for nonsuicida l self-injury reaches a peak at 20–29 years of
age and then declines. However, research that  has examined age at hospitalization did not
provide information on age at onset of the behavior, and prospective research is needed to
outline the natural history of nonsuicidal self-injury and the factors that promote or in-
hibit its course. Individuals often learn of th e behavior on the recommendation or observa-
tion of another. Research has shown that wh en an individual who engages in nonsuicidal
self-injury is admitted to an inpatient unit, other individuals may begin to engage in the
behavior",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,849
"Risk and Prognostic Factors
Male and female prevalence rates of nonsuicida l self-injury are closer to each other than in
suicidal behavior disorder, in which the female-to-male ratio is about 3:1 or 4:1",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,849
"Two theories of psychopathology—based on functional behavioral analyses—have been
proposed: In the first, based on learning theo ry, either positive or negative reinforcement
sustains the behavior. Positive reinforcement might result fr om punishing oneself in a way
that the individual feels is de served, with the behavior induci ng a pleasant and relaxed state
or generating attention and help from a signific ant other, or as an expression of anger. Neg-
ative reinforcement results from affect regula tion and the reduction of unpleasant emotions
or avoiding distressing thoughts, including th inking about suicide. In the second theory,
nonsuicidal self-injury is thought to be a form of self-punishment, in which self-punitive ac-
tions are engaged in to make up for acts that caused distress or harm to others.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,849

Functional Consequences of  Nonsuicidal Self-Injury
The act of cutting might be performed with shared implements, raising the possibility of
blood-borne disease transmission",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,850
"Differential Diagnosis
Borderline personality disorder. As indicated, nonsuicidal se lf-injury has long been re-
garded as a “symptom” of borderline pers onality disorder, even though comprehensive
clinical evaluations have found that most individuals with nonsuicidal self-injury have
symptoms that also meet criteria for other di agnoses, with eating disorders and substance
use disorders being especially common. Histor ically, nonsuicidal self-injury was regarded
as pathognomonic of borderline personality d isorder. Both conditions are associated with
several other diagnoses. Although frequently  associated, borderline personality disorder
is not invariably found in individuals with no nsuicidal self-injury. The two conditions dif-
fer in several ways. Individuals with borderline personality disorder often manifest dis-
turbed aggressive and hostile behaviors, whereas nonsuicidal self-injury is more often
associated with phases of closeness, collaborati ve behaviors, and positive relationships. At
a more fundamental level, there are difference s in the involvement of different neurotrans-
mitter systems, but these will not be apparent on clinical examination. 
Suicidal behavior disorder. The differentiation between nonsuicidal self-injury and sui-
cidal behavior disorder is base d either on the stated goal of  the behavior being a wish to
die (suicidal behavior disorder) or, in nonsuicidal self-injury, to experience relief as de-
scribed in the criteria. Depending on the ci rcumstances, individuals may provide reports
of convenience, and several studies report high  rates of false intent declaration. Individu-
als with a history of frequent nonsuicidal se lf-injury episodes have learned that a session
of cutting, while painful, is, in the short-term, largely benign. Be cause individuals with
nonsuicidal self-injury can and do attempt and commit suicide,  it is important to check
past history of suicidal behavior and to ob tain information from a third party concerning
any recent change in stress exposure and mo od. Likelihood of suicide intent has been as-
sociated with the use of multiple  previous methods of self-harm. 
In a follow-up study of cases of “self-harm” in males treated at one of several multiple
emergency centers in the United Kingdom, in dividuals with nonsuicidal self-injury were
significantly more likely to commit suicide th an other teenage individuals drawn from the
same cohort. Studies that have examined the relationship be tween nonsuicidal self-injury
and suicidal behavior disorder  are limited by being retrospe ctive and failing to obtain ver-
ified accounts of the method used during pr evious “attempts.” A significant proportion of
those who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury have responded positively when asked if they
have ever engaged in self-cutti ng (or their preferred means of self-injury) with an intention
to die. It is reasonable to co nclude that nonsuicidal self-injury, while not presenting a high
risk for suicide when first manifested, is an  especially dangerous form of self-injurious
behavior",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,850
"This conclusion is also supported by a mult isite study of depressed adolescents who had
previously failed to respond to  antidepressant medi cation, which noted th at those with pre-
vious nonsuicidal self-inj ury did not respond to cognitive-behavioral therapy,  and by a study
that found that nonsuicida l self-injury is a predicto r of substance use/misuse.

fined to pulling out one’s own hair, most commonly from the sc alp, eyebrows, or eyelashes",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,850

"Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Excoriation disorder occurs mainly in females and
is usually directed to picking at an area of th e skin that the individual feels is unsightly or
a blemish, usually on the face or the scalp. As in nonsuicidal self-injury, the picking is often
preceded by an urge and is experienced as pleasurable, even thoug h the individual real-
izes that he or she is harming himself or hersel f. It is not associated with the use of any im-
plement.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,851

Changes made to DSM-5  diagnostic criteria and text s are outlined in this chapter
in the same order in which they appear in the DSM-5 classification. This abbreviated descrip-
tion is intended to orient readers to only the most significant changes in each disorder cate-

lectual developmental disorder)  is the term that has come into common use over the past
two decades among medical, ed ucational, and other professi onals, and by the lay public
and advocacy groups. Diagnostic criteria em phasize the need for an assessment of both

ity disorder  (ADHD). Examples have been added to the criterion items to facilitate application
across the life span; the age at onset descri ption has been changed (from “some hyperactive-
impulsive or inattentive symptoms that caused impairment were present before age 7 years”
to “Several inattentive or hy peractive-impulsive symptoms we re present prior to age 12”);
subtypes have been replaced with presentation specifiers that map directly to the prior sub-
types; a comorbid diagnosis with autism spec trum disorder is now allowed; and a symptom
threshold change has been made for adults, to reflect the substantial evidence of clinically sig-
nificant ADHD impairment, with the cutoff for ADHD of five symptoms, instead of six re-

"Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders
Two changes were made to Criterion A for schizophrenia:  1) the elimination of the special at-
tribution of bizarre delusions and Schneiderian fi rst-rank auditory hallucinations (e.g., two or
more voices conversing), leadin g to the requirement of at least two Criterion A symptoms for
any diagnosis of schizophrenia, and 2) the addition  of the requirement that at least one of the
Criterion A symptoms must be delusions, hallu cinations, or disorganized speech. The DSM-IV
subtypes of schizophrenia were eliminated due to their limited diagnostic stability, low reli-
ability, and poor validity. Instead, a dimensional approach to rating severity for the core symp-
toms of schizophrenia is includ ed in DSM-5 Section III to capt ure the important heterogeneity
in symptom type and severity  expressed across individual s with psychotic disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,855
"Schizoaffective disorder  is reconceptualized as a longitudin al instead of a cross-sectional di-
agnosis—more comparable to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and majo r depressive disorder,
which are bridged by this condition—and requires  that a major mood episode be present for a
majority of the total disorder ’s duration after Criterion A has been met. Criterion A for delu-
sional disorder no longer has the requirement that th e delusions must be nonbizarre; a spec-
ifier is now included for bizarre type delusions to provide continuity with DSM-IV. Criteria for
catatonia are described uniformly across DSM-5. Fu rthermore, catatonia may be diagnosed
with a specifier (for depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders, incl uding schizophrenia), in
the context of a known medical condition,  or as an other specified diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,855
"Bipolar and Related Disorders
Diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorders  now include both changes in mood and changes in
activity or energy. The DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, mixed episodes—requiring
that the individual simultaneous ly meet full criteria for both mania and major depressive ep-
isode—is replaced with a new specifier “with mixed features.” Particular conditions can
now be diagnosed under other specified bipolar and related disorder, including categori-
zation for individuals with a past history of  a major depressive di sorder whose symptoms
meet all criteria for hypomania except the duration criterion is  not met (i.e., the episode lasts
only 2 or 3 days instead of the required 4 cons ecutive days or more). A second condition con-
stituting an other specified bipolar and related disorder variant is that too few symptoms of
hypomania are present to meet criteria for the full bipolar II syndrome, although the dura-
tion, at least 4 consecutive days, is sufficient. Finally, in both this chapter and in the chapter
“Depressive Disorders,” an anxious distress specifier is delineated",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,855
"Depressive Disorders
To address concerns about potential overdiagno sis and overtreatment of bipolar disorder in
children, a new diagnosis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder,  is included for children
up to age 18 years who exhibit persistent irrita bility and frequent episodes of extreme behav-
ioral dyscontrol. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder  is now promoted from Appendix B, “Cri-
teria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study, ” in DSM-IV to the main body of DSM-5. What
was referred to as dysthymia in DSM-IV now falls under the category of persistent depressive
disorder,  which includes both chronic major depre ssive disorder and the previous dysthymic
disorder. The coexistence within a major depressive episode  of at least three manic symp-
toms (insufficient to satisfy cr iteria for a manic episode) is no w acknowledged by the specifier",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,855
"Highlights of Changes From DSM-IV to DSM-5 811
“with mixed features.” In DSM-IV, there was an exclusion criterion for a major depressive ep-
isode that was applied to depressive symptoms lasting less than 2 months following the death
of a loved one (i.e., the bereavement exclusion). This exclusion is omitted in DSM-5 for several
reasons, including the recognitio n that bereavement is a severe psychosocial stressor that can
precipitate a major depressive episode in a vu lnerable individual, generally beginning soon
after the loss, and can add an additional risk for suffering, feelings of worthlessness, suicidal
ideation, poorer medical health, and worse interp ersonal and work functioning. It was critical
to remove the implication that bereavement ty pically lasts only 2 months, when both physi-
cians and grief counselors recognize that the duration is more commonly 1–2 years. A detailed
footnote has replaced the more simplistic DSM- IV exclusion to aid clinicians in making the
critical distinction between the symptoms characteristic of be reavement and those of a major
depressive disorder. Finally, a new specifier to  indicate the presence of mixed symptoms has
been added across both the bipo lar and the depressive disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,856
"Anxiety Disorders
The chapter on anxiety disorders no longer includes obsessive-compulsive disorder (which
is in the new chapter “Obsessive-Compulsiv e and Related Disorders”) or posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and acut e stress disorder (which are in the new chapter “Trauma-
and Stressor-Related Disorders”). Changes in criteria for specific phobia  and social anxiety
disorder (social phobia)  include deletion of the requirement that individuals over age 18
years recognize that their anxiet y is excessive or unreasonable . Instead, the anxiety must be
out of proportion to the actual danger or threat  in the situation, after cultural contextual fac-
tors are taken into account. In addition, the 6-month duration is now extended to all ages",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,856
"Panic attacks  can now be listed as a specifier that is applicable to all DSM-5 disorders. Panic
disorder  and agoraphobia  are unlinked in DSM-5. Thus, the former DSM-IV diagnoses of
panic disorder with agoraphobia, panic disorder without agoraphobia, and agoraphobia
without history of panic disorder are now replaced by two diagnoses, panic disorder and ag-
oraphobia, each with separate crit eria. The “generalized” specifier for social anxiety disor-
der has been deleted and replaced with a “performance only” specifier. Separation anxiety
disorder  and selective mutism  are now classified as anxiety di sorders. The wording of the
criteria is modified to more adequately repres ent the expression of se paration anxiety symp-
toms in adulthood. Also, in contrast to DSM-IV, the diagnostic criteria no longer specify that
onset must be before age 18 years, and a duration statement—“typically lasting for 6 months
or more”—has been added for adults to minimize overdia gnosis of transient fears",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,856
"Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders
The chapter “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders” is new in DSM-5. New disor-
ders include hoarding disorder, excoriation (skin-pi cking) disorder, substance/medica-
tion-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,  and obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder due to another medical condition.  The DSM-IV diagnosis of trichotillo-
mania is now termed trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and has been moved from a
DSM-IV classification of impulse-control di sorders not elsewhere classified to obsessive-
compulsive and related disorders in DSM-5. The DSM-IV “with poor insight” specifier for
obsessive-compulsive disorder  has been refined to allow a distinction between individuals
with good or fair insight, poor insight, and “absent insight/delusional” obsessive-compul-
sive disorder beliefs (i.e., comp lete conviction that obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs
are true). Analogous “insight” specifiers have  been included for body dysmorphic disorder
and hoarding disorder. A “tic-related” specifier for obsessive-compuls ive disorder has also
been added, because presence of a comorbid tic disorder may have important clinical im-
plications. A “muscle dy smorphia” specifier for body dysmorphic disorder  is added to re-
flect a growing literature on the diagnostic validity and clinical utility of making this",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,856

dysmorphic disorder (which identifies individu als who are completely convinced that their
perceived defects or flaws are truly abnormal ap pearing) is no longer coded as both delu-
sional disorder, somatic type, and body dysmorph ic disorder; in DSM-5, this presentation is
designated only as body dysmorphic disorder with the absent insight/delusional specifier",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,857

"Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders
For a diagnosis of acute stress disorder,  qualifying traumatic events are now explicit as to
whether they were experienced directly, witnessed, or experienced indirectly. Also, the
DSM-IV Criterion A2 regarding the subjective reaction to th e traumatic event (e.g., expe-
riencing “fear, helplessness, or  horror”) has been eliminated. Adjustment disorders  are
reconceptualized as a heterogeneous array of  stress-response syndromes that occur after
exposure to a distressing (traum atic or nontraumatic) event, rather than as a residual cat-
egory for individuals who exhibit clinically  significant distress but whose symptoms do
not meet criteria for a more d iscrete disorder (as in DSM-IV)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,857
"DSM-5 criteria for PTSD differ significantly from the DS M-IV criteria. The stressor cri-
terion (Criterion A) is more ex plicit with regard to events that qualify as “traumatic” ex-
periences. Also, DSM-IV Criterion A2 (subje ctive reaction) has been eliminated. Whereas
there were three major symptom clusters in DSM-IV—reexperiencing, avoidance/numb-
ing, and arousal—there are no w four symptom clusters in DSM-5, because the avoidance/
numbing cluster is divided into two distinct clusters: avoidance and persistent negative al-
terations in cognitions and mood. This latter  category, which retains most of the DSM-IV
numbing symptoms, also includes new or re conceptualized symptoms, such as persistent
negative emotional states. The final cluster— alterations in arousal and reactivity—retains
most of the DSM-IV arousal symptoms. It also includes irritable behavior or angry out-
bursts and reckless or self-destructive beha vior. PTSD is now develo pmentally sensitive in
that diagnostic thresholds have been lowe red for children and adolescents. Furthermore,
separate criteria have been added for childre n age 6 years or younger with this disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,857
"The DSM-IV childhood diagno sis reactive attachment di sorder had two subtypes:
emotionally withdrawn/inhibited and indiscri minately social/disinhibited. In DSM-5,
these subtypes are defined as distinct disorders: reactive attachment disorder  and disin-
hibited social engagement disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,857
"Dissociative Disorders
Major changes in dissociative disorders in DS M-5 include the following: 1) derealization is
included in the name and symptom structure of what previously was called depersonali-
zation disorder ( depersonalization/derealization disorder ); 2) dissociative fugue is now a
specifier of dissociative amnesia rather than a separate diagnosis, and 3) the criteria for
dissociative identity disorder  have been changed to indicate that symptoms of disruption
of identity may be reported as well as observed, and that gaps in the recall of events may
occur for everyday and not just traumatic ev ents. Also, experiences of pathological pos-
session in some cultures are included in the description of identity disruption",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,857
"Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders
In DSM-5, somatoform disorders are now referred to as somatic symptom and related dis-
orders.  The DSM-5 classification reduces the number of these disorders and subcategories to
avoid problematic overlap. Diagnoses of somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, pain dis-
order, and undifferentiated somatoform diso rder have been removed. Individuals previ-",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,857

ously diagnosed with somatization disorder wi ll usually have sympto ms that meet DSM-5
criteria for somatic symptom disorder,  but only if they have th e maladaptive thoughts, feel-
ings, and behaviors that define the disorder, in addition to their somatic symptoms. Because
the distinction between somati zation disorder and undifferen tiated somatoform disorder
was arbitrary, they are merged in DSM-5 un der somatic symptom diso rder. Individuals pre-
viously diagnosed with hypochondriasis who have high health anxiety but no somatic symp-
toms would receive a DSM-5 diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder (unless their health
anxiety was better explained by  a primary anxiety disorder, su ch as generalized anxiety dis-
order). Some individuals with chronic pain w ould be appropriately di agnosed as having so-
matic symptom disorder, with predominant pain . For others, psychological factors affecting
other medical conditions or an adjustment disorder would be more appropriate",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,858
"Psychological factors affect ing other medical conditions  is a new mental disorder in
DSM-5, having formerly been listed in the DSM-IV chapter “Other Conditions That May
Be a Focus of Clinical At tention.” This disorder and factitious disorder  are placed among
the somatic symptom and related disorders because somatic symptoms are predominant
in both disorders, and both are most often en countered in medical settings. The variants of
psychological factors affecting other medical conditions are removed in favor of the stem
diagnosis. Criteria for conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder)
have been modified to emphasize the essent ial importance of the neurological examina-
tion, and in recognition that relevant psychological factors may not be demonstrable at the
time of diagnosis. Other spec ified somatic symptom disorder , other specified illness anx-
iety disorder, and pseudocyesis ar e now the only exemplars of the other specified somatic
symptom and related disorder classification",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,858
"Feeding and Eating Disorders
Because of the elimination of the DSM-IV-TR chapter “Disorders Us ually First Diagnosed
During Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence,” th is chapter describes several disorders found in
the DSM-IV section “Feeding and Eating Disord ers of Infancy or Early Childhood,” such as
pica  and rumination disorder.  The DSM-IV category feeding disorder of infancy or early
childhood has been renamed avoidant/restrictive f ood intake disorder,  and the criteria are
significantly expanded. The core diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa  are conceptually un-
changed from DSM-IV with one exception: the requirement for amenorrhea is eliminated. As
in DSM-IV, individuals with this disorder are requ ired by Criterion A to be at a significantly
low body weight for their developmental stage.  The wording of the criterion is changed for
clarification, and guidan ce regarding how to judge whether an individual is at or below a sig-
nificantly low weight is provided in the text. In  DSM-5, Criterion B is expanded to include not
only overtly expressed fear of weight gain but also persistent behavior that interferes with
weight gain. The only change in the DSM-IV criteria for bulimia nervosa  is a reduction in the
required minimum average frequency of binge eating and inappropri ate compensatory be-
havior frequency from twice to once weekly. The extensive research that followed the prom-
ulgation of preliminary criteria for binge-eating disorder  in Appendix B of DSM-IV
documented the clinical utility and validity of binge-eating disorder. The only significant dif-
ference from the prelimin ary criteria is that the minimum average frequency of binge eating re-
quired for diagnosis is once weekly over the la st 3 months, identical to the frequency criterion
for bulimia nervosa (rather than at least 2 days a week for 6 months in DSM-IV)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,858

"814 Highlights of Changes From DSM-IV to DSM-5
Sleep-Wake Disorders
In DSM-5, the DSM-IV diagnose s named sleep disorder related to another mental disorder
and sleep disorder related to another medica l condition have been removed, and instead
greater specification of coexisting conditions is provided for each sleep-wake disorder. The
diagnosis of primary insomnia has been renamed insomnia disorder  to avoid the differen-
tiation between primary and secondary insomnia. DSM-5 also distinguishes narcolepsy —
now known to be associated with hypocretin deficiency—from other forms of hypersomno-
lence (hypersomnolence disorder ). Finally, throughout the DSM-5 classification of sleep-
wake disorders, pediatric and developmental cr iteria and text are integrated where existing
science and considerations of clinical utility support such integration. Breathing-related
sleep disorders are divided into three relatively distinct disorders: obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation. The subtypes of circadian
rhythm sleep disorders  are expanded to include advanced  sleep phase type and irregular
sleep-wake type, whereas the jet lag type has b een removed. The use of the former “not oth-
erwise specified” diagnoses in DSM- IV have been reduced by elevating rapid eye move-
ment sleep behavior disorder  and restless legs syndrome  to independent disorders",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,859
"Sexual Dysfunctions
In DSM-5, some gender-specifi c sexual dysfunctions have been added, and, for females,
sexual desire and arousal disorders have  been combined into one disorder: female sexual
interest/arousal disorder.  All of the sexual dysfunctions (except substance/medication-in-
duced sexual dysfunction ) now require a minimum duration of approximately 6 months and
more precise severity criteria. Genito-pelvic pain/p enetration disorder  has been added to
DSM-5 and represents a merging of vaginismus and dyspareunia, which were highly co-
morbid and difficult to distinguish. The diagno sis of sexual aversion disorder has been re-
moved due to rare use and la ck of supporting research",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,859
"There are now only two subtyp es for sexual dysfunctions: lifelong versus  acquired
and generalized  versus situational.  To indicate the presence and degree of medical and
other nonmedical correlates, the following associated features  have been added to the text:
partner factors, relationship factors, individu al vulnerability factors, cultural or religious
factors, and medical factors",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,859
"Gender Dysphoria
Gender dysphoria  is a new diagnostic class in DSM-5 and reflects a change in conceptual-
ization of the disorder’s defining features by emphasizing the phenomenon of “gender in-
congruence” rather than cross-gender identification per se, as was the case in DSM-IV gender
identity disorder. Gender dyspho ria includes separate sets of criteria: for children and for
adults and adolescents. For the adolescents an d adults criteria, the previous Criterion A
(cross-gender identification) and Criterion B (aversion toward one’s gender) are merged. In
the wording of the criteria, “the other sex” is replaced by “the other gender” (or “some alter-
native gender”).” Gender  instead of sex is used systematically because the concept “sex” is in-
adequate when referring to individuals with a disorder of sex development. In the child
criteria, “strong desire to be of the other gend er” replaces the previous “repeatedly stated de-
sire to be...the other sex” to capture the situat ion of some children who, in a coercive envi-
ronment, may not verbalize the desire to be of  another gender. For child ren, Criterion A1 (“a
strong desire to be of the other gender or an in sistence that he or she is the other gender.. .)”
is now necessary (but not sufficient), which makes the diagnosi s more restrictive and conser-
vative. The subtyping on the basis of sexual or ientation is removed because the distinction is
no longer considered clinically useful. A posttransition specifier  has been added to identify",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,859
"Highlights of Changes From DSM-IV to DSM-5 815
individuals who have undergone at least one medical procedure or treatment to support the
new gender assignment (e.g., cross-sex hormon e treatment). Although the concept of post-
transition is modeled on the concept of full or partial remission, the term remission  has impli-
cations in terms of symptom reduction that do not apply directly to gender dysphoria",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,860
"Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders
The chapter “Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders” is new to DSM-5 and
combines disorders that were pr eviously included in the chapte r “Disorders Usually First Di-
agnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence” (i.e., oppositional defiant disorder; conduct
disorder; and disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified, now categorized as other
specified and unspecified disrup tive, impulse-control, and cond uct disorders) and the chap-
ter “Impulse-Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Cl assified” (i.e., intermittent explosive disor-
der, pyromania, and kleptomania). These diso rders are all characterized by problems in
emotional and behavioral self-control. Notably,  ADHD is frequently comorbid with the dis-
orders in this chapter but is listed with the neurodevelopmental disorders. Because of its
close association with co nduct disorder, antisocial  personality disorder is listed both in this
chapter and in the chapter “Personality Diso rders,” where it is described in detail",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,860
"The criteria for oppositional defiant disorder  are now grouped into three types: an-
gry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant be havior, and vindictiveness. Additionally,
the exclusionary criterion for conduct diso rder has been removed. The criteria for conduct
disorder include a descriptive features specifier for individuals who meet full criteria for
the disorder but al so present with limited prosocial emotions. The primary change in in-
termittent explosive disorder  is in the type of aggressive outbursts that should be consid-
ered: DSM-IV required physical aggression, whereas in DSM-5 verbal aggression and
nondestructive/noninjurious physical aggression  also meet criteria. DSM-5 also provides
more specific criteria defining  frequency needed to meet the criteria and specifies that the
aggressive outbursts ar e impulsive and/or anger based in nature, and must cause marked
distress, cause impairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or be associated
with negative financial or legal consequences. Furthermore, a minimum age of 6 years (or
equivalent developmental level) is now required",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,860
"Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
An important departure from past diagnostic ma nuals is that the chapter on substance-related
disorders has been expanded to include gambling disorder. Another key change is that
DSM-5 does not separate the diagnoses of substance abuse  and dependence  as in DSM-IV. Rather
criteria are provided for substance use disorder,  accompanied by criteria for intoxication,
withdrawal, substance-induced disorders, and unspecified substance-related disorders,
where relevant. Within substance use disorders,  the DSM-IV recurrent substance-related legal
problems criterion has been dele ted from DSM-5, and a new criter ion—craving, or a strong de-
sire or urge to use a substance—has been adde d. In addition, the thre shold for substance use
disorder diagnosis in DSM-5 is set at two or more  criteria, in contrast to a threshold of one or
more criteria for a diagnosis of DSM-IV substance abuse and three or more for DSM-IV depen-
dence. Cannabis withdrawal and caffeine withdrawal  are new disorders (the latter was in
DSM-IV Appendix B, “Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study”)",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,860
"Severity  of the DSM-5 substance use disorders is  based on the number of criteria en-
dorsed. The DSM-IV specifier fo r a physiological subtype is eliminated in DSM-5, as is the
DSM-IV diagnosis of polysubstance dependence. Early remission from a DSM-5 substance
use disorder is defined as at least 3 but less than 12 months without meeting substance use
disorder criteria (except crav ing), and sustained remission is defined as at least 12 months
without meeting criteria (except craving). Additional new DSM-5 specifiers include “in a
controlled environment”  and “on maintenance therapy”  as the situation warrants.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,860
"816 Highlights of Changes From DSM-IV to DSM-5
Neurocognitive Disorders
The DSM-IV diagnoses of dementia and amnestic disorder are subsumed under the newly
named entity major neurocognitive disorder  (NCD). The term dementia  is not precluded from
use in the etiological subtypes where that te rm is standard. Furthermore, DSM-5 now recog-
nizes a less severe level of cognitive impairment, mild NCD,  which is a new disorder that per-
mits the diagnosis of less disabling syndromes that may nonetheless be the focus of concern
and treatment. Diagnostic criteria  are provided for both of these disorders, foll owed by diag-
nostic criteria for different etiological subtypes.  In DSM-IV, individual diagnoses were desig-
nated for dementia of the Alzheimer’s type , vascular dementia, and substance-induced
dementia, whereas the other neurodegenerative disorders were classified as dementia due to
another medical condition, with HIV, head trauma, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease,
Pick’s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jako b disease, and other medical co nditions specified. In DSM-5,
major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s disease and major or mild vascular NCD have been re-
tained, while new separate criteria are now presented for major or mild frontotemporal NCD,
NCD with Lewy bodies, and NCDs due to trau matic brain injury, a substance/medication,
HIV infection, prion disease, Parkinson’s diseas e, Huntington’s disease, another medical con-
dition, and multiple etiologies, respectively. Un specified NCD is also included as a diagnosis",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,861
"Personality Disorders
The criteria for personality disorders in Sectio n II of DSM-5 have not changed from those in
DSM-IV. An alternative approach to the diag nosis of personality di sorders was developed
for DSM-5 for further study and can be found in Section III (see “Alternative DSM-5 Model
for Personality Disorders”). For the general criteria for personality disorder, presented  in
Section III, a revised personality functioning criterion (Criterion A) has been developed
based on a literature review of reliable clinical  measures of core impa irments central to per-
sonality pathology. A diagnosis of personality disorder—trait specified,  based on moderate
or greater impairment in person ality functioning and the presence of pathological personal-
ity traits, replaces personality disorder not ot herwise specified and prov ides a much more in-
formative diagnosis for individuals who are not optimally described as having a specific
personality disorder. A greater emphasis on pe rsonality functioning and trait-based criteria
increases the stability and empiri cal bases of the disorders. Personality functioning and per-
sonality traits  also can be assessed whether or not the individual has a personality disor-
der—a feature that provides clinically useful information about all individuals",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,861
"Paraphilic Disorders
An overarching change from DSM-IV is the addition of the course specifiers “in a controlled
environment”  and “in remission”  to the diagnostic criteria se ts for all the paraphilic disor-
ders. These specifiers are added to indicate important changes in an individual’s status. In
DSM-5, paraphilias are not ipso facto  mental disorders. There is a distinction between paraphil-
ias and paraphilic disorders. A paraphilic disorder is a paraphilia that is currently causing dis-
tress or impairment to the individual or a pa raphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal
harm, or risk of harm, to others. A paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for
having a paraphilic disorder, and a paraphilia by it self does not automatically justify or require
clinical intervention. The distinction between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders was im-
plemented without making any changes to the basi c structure of the diagnostic criteria as they
had existed since DSM-III-R. Th e change proposed for DSM-5 is that individuals who meet
both Criterion A and Criterion B would now be diagnosed as having a paraphilic disorder. A
diagnosis would not be given to  individuals whose symptoms meet Criterion A but not Cri-
terion B—that is, to individuals who have  a paraphilia but not a paraphilic disorder. ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,861

Concepts of Distress
Ataque de nervios
Ataque de nervios  (“attack of nerves”) is a syndrome among individuals of Latino descent,
characterized by symptoms of intense emotio nal upset, including acut e anxiety, anger, or
grief; screaming and shouting uncontrollably; a ttacks of crying; tremblin g; heat in the chest
rising into the head; and becomi ng verbally and physically ag gressive. Dissociative experi-
ences (e.g., depersonalization, derealization, am nesia), seizure-like or fainting episodes, and
suicidal gestures are prominent in some ataques  but absent in others. A general feature of an
ataque de nervios  is a sense of being out of control. Attacks frequently occur as a direct result
of a stressful event relating to the family, such as news of the death of a close relative, con-
flicts with a spouse or childr en, or witnessing an accident involving a family member. For a
minority of individuals, no partic ular social event triggers their ataques;  instead, their vul-
nerability to losing control comes from the accumulated experience of suffering",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,878
"No one-to-one relationship  has been found between ataque  and any specific psychiatric dis-
order, although several disorders, including pani c disorder, other specif ied or unspecified dis-
sociative disorder, and conversion diso rder, have symptomatic overlap with ataque ",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,878
"In community samples, ataque  is associated with suicidal  ideation, disability, and out-

"Dhat syndrome
Dhat syndrome  is a term that was coined in South Asia  little more than half a century ago to
account for common clinical presentations of young male patients who attributed their
various symptoms to semen loss. Despite the name, it is not a discrete syndrome but rather
a cultural explanation of distress for patients  who refer to diverse symptoms, such as anx-
iety, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, impotence, other multiple somatic complaints, and
depressive mood. The cardinal feature is an xiety and distress about the loss of dhat in the
absence of any identifiable physiological dysfunction. Dhat  was identified by patients as
a white discharge that was noted on defecation  or urination. Ideas about this substance
are related to the concept of dhatu  (semen) described in the Hindu system of medicine,
Ayurveda, as one of seven essential bodily fluids whose balance is necessary to maintain
health.",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,878
"834 Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress
Although dhat syndrome  was formulated as a cultural guide to local clinical practice, related
ideas about the harmful effects of  semen loss have been shown to be widespread in the general
population, suggesting a cultural disposition for explaining health problems and symptoms
with reference to dhat syndrome.  Research in health care settings has yielded diverse estimates
of the syndrome’s prevalence (e .g., 64% of men attending psychiatric clinics in India for sexual
complaints; 30% of men attending general medical clinics in Pakistan). Although dhat syndrome
is most commonly identified with young men from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, mid-
dle-aged men may also be affe cted. Comparable concerns about white vaginal discharge (leu-
korrhea) have been associated with a variant of the concept for women",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,879

"Khyâl cap
“Khyâl  attacks” ( khyâl cap ), or “wind attacks,” is a synd rome found among Cambodians in
the United States and Cambodia. Common symptoms include those of panic attacks, such
as dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath, and cold extremities, as well as other symp-
toms of anxiety and auto nomic arousal (e.g., tinnitus and neck soreness). Khyâl  attacks in-
clude catastrophic cognitions centered on the concern that khyâl  (a windlike substance)
may rise in the body—along wi th blood—and cause a range of  serious effects (e.g., com-
pressing the lungs to cause shortness of breath and asphyxia; entering the cranium to
cause tinnitus, dizziness, blurry vision, and a fatal syncope). Khyâl attacks may occur with-
out warning, but are frequently brought abou t by triggers such as  worrisome thoughts,
standing up (i.e., orthostasis), specific odor s with negative associations, and agoraphobic-
type cues like going to crowded spaces or riding in a car. Khyâl  attacks usually meet panic
attack criteria and may shape the experience  of other anxiety and trauma- and stressor-
related disorders. Khyâl attacks may be associated with considerable disability",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,879

much”). As an idiom of psychosocial distress, it is indicative of interpersonal and social
difficulties (e.g., marital problems, having no money to take care of children). Kufungisisa
involves ruminating on upsettin g thoughts, particularly worries",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,879

"Maladi moun
Maladi moun  (literally “humanly caused illness,” also referred to as “sent sickness”) is a
cultural explanation in Haitian communitie s for diverse medical and psychiatric disor-
ders. In this explanatory mode l, interpersonal envy and malice cause people to harm their
enemies by sending illnesses such as psychosis,  depression, social or academic failure, and
inability to perform activities  of daily living. The etiological model assumes that illness
may be caused by others’ envy and hatred, pr ovoked by the victim’s economic success as
evidenced by a new job or expensive purchase . One person’s gain is assumed to produce
another person’s loss, so visible success make s one vulnerable to attack. Assigning the la-
bel of sent sickness depends on mode of on set and social status more than presenting
symptoms. The acute onset of new symptoms or  an abrupt behavioral  change raises sus-
picions of a spiritual attack. Someone who is at tractive, intelligent, or wealthy is perceived
as especially vulnerable, and even young healthy children are at risk",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,880

"Nervios
Nervios  (“nerves”) is a common idiom of distress among Latinos in the United States and
Latin America. Nervios  refers to a general state of vulne rability to stressful life experiences
and to difficult life circumstances. The term nervios  includes a wide range of symptoms of
emotional distress, somatic disturbance, an d inability to function. The most common
symptoms attributed to nervios  include headaches and “brain aches” (occipital neck ten-
sion), irritability, stomach disturbances, slee p difficulties, nervousness, easy tearfulness,
inability to concentrat e, trembling, tingling sensations, and mareos  (dizziness with occa-
sional vertigo-like exacerbations). Nervios  is a broad idiom of distress that spans the range
of severity from cases with no mental diso rder to presentations resembling adjustment,
anxiety, depressive, dissociative, somatic symptom, or psychotic disorders. “Being ner-
vous since childhood” appears to  be more of a trait and may precede social anxiety disor-
der, while “being ill with nerves” is more related than other forms of nervios  to psychiatric
problems, especially dissociation and depression",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,880

"836 Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress
Western diagnosis of neurasthenia. In the second, revised edition of the Chinese Classifica-
tion of Mental Disorders  (CCMD-2-R), shenjing shuairuo is defined as a syndrome composed
of three out of five nonhierarchical symptom clusters: weak ness (e.g., mental fatigue),
emotions (e.g., feeling vexed), excitement (e.g.,  increased recollections), nervous pain (e.g.,
headache), and sleep (e.g., insomnia). Fan nao  (feeling vexed) is a form  of irritability mixed
with worry and distress over conflicting thoug hts and unfulfilled desires. The third edi-
tion of the CCMD retains shenjing shuairuo  as a somatoform diagno sis of exclusion. Salient
precipitants of shenjing shuairuo  include work- or family-rel ated stressors, loss of face
(mianzi, lianzi ), and an acute sense of failure (e.g., in academic performance). Shenjing sh-
uairuo  is related to traditional concepts of weakness ( xu) and health imbalances related to
deficiencies of a vital essence (e.g., the depletion of qi [vital energy] following overstrain-
ing or stagnation of qi due to excessive worry). In the traditional interpretation, shenjing
shuairuo  results when bodily channels ( jing) conveying vital forces ( shen) become dysreg-
ulated as a result of various social and interpersonal stressors, such as the inability to
change a chronically frustrating and distressi ng situation. Various psychiatric disorders
are associated with shenjing shuairuo,  notably mood, anxiety, and somatic symptom disor-
ders. In medical clinics in China, however, up to 45% of patients with shenjing shuairuo  do
not meet criteria for any DSM-IV disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,881

"Susto
Susto  (“fright”) is a cultural explanation fo r distress and misfortune prevalent among
some Latinos in the United States and amon g people in Mexico, Central America, and
South America. It is no t recognized as an illness catego ry among Latinos from the Carib-
bean. Susto  is an illness attributed to a frightenin g event that causes the soul to leave the
body and results in unhappiness and sickness, as well as difficulties functioning in key
social roles. Symptoms may appear any time from days to years after the fright is experi-
enced. In extreme cases, susto  may result in death. There are no specific defining symp-
toms for susto; however, symptoms that are often reported by people with susto  include
appetite disturbances, inadequa te or excessive sleep, troubled sleep or dreams, feelings of
sadness, low self-worth or dirtiness, interperso nal sensitivity, and lack of motivation to do
anything. Somatic symptoms accompanying susto may include muscle aches and pains,
cold in the extremities, pallo r, headache, stomachache, and diarrhea. Precipitating events

natural agents, among others",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,881

sonal susto  characterized by feelings of loss, aban donment, and not being loved by family,
with accompanying symptoms of sadness, poor  self-image, and suicidal ideation, seemed to
be closely related to major depressive disorder. When susto  resulted from a traumatic event
that played a major role in shaping symptoms and in emotional processing of the experience,
the diagnosis of posttrauma tic stress disorder appe ared more appropriate. Susto  character-
ized by various recurrent somatic symptoms—for  which the person sought health care from
several practitioners—was thought to resemble a somatic symptom disorder",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,881

Taijin kyofusho  (“interpersonal fear disorder” in Japa nese) is a cultural syndrome charac-
terized by anxiety about and av oidance of interpersonal situations due to the thought, feel-
ing, or conviction that one’s appearance and actions in social interactions are inadequate
or offensive to others. In the United States, the variant involves having an offensive body
odor and is termed olfactory reference syndrome.  Individuals with taijin kyofusho  tend to focus
on the impact of their symptoms and behavior s on others. Variants include major concerns
about facial blushing (erythrophobia), having an offensive body odor (olfactory reference
syndrome), inappropriate gaze (too much or too little eye co ntact), stiff or awkward facial
expression or bodily moveme nts (e.g., stiffening, trem bling), or body deformity",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,882
"Taijin kyofusho  is a broader construct than social an xiety disorder in DSM-5. In addition
to performance anxiety, taijin kyofusho  includes two culture-relate d forms: a “sensitive type,”
with extreme social sensitivity and anxiety about interpersonal inte ractions, and an “of-
fensive type,” in which the major concer n is offending others. As a category, taijin kyofusho
thus includes syndromes with features of body dysmorphic disorder as well as delusional
disorder. Concerns may have a delusional qualit y, responding poorly to simple reassurance
or counterexample",Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders _ DSM-5 ( PDFDrive.com ).pdf,882

"What is autism spectrum disorder?
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and 
behavior. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a “developmental 
disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life. 
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5),  a guide 
created by the American Psychiatric Association used to diagnose mental disorders, 
people with ASD have:
 ⊲Difficulty with communication and interaction with other people
 ⊲Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors
 ⊲Symptoms that affect the person’s ability to function in school, work, and other 
areas of life
Autism is known as a “spectrum” disorder because there is wide variation in the type 
and severity of symptoms people experience. 
ASD occurs in all ethnic, racial, and economic groups. Although ASD can be a lifelong 
disorder, treatments and services can improve a person’s symptoms and ability to function. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for 
autism. All caregivers should talk to their child’s doctor about ASD screening or evaluation",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,2
"What are the signs and symptoms of ASD?
People with ASD have difficulty with social communication and interaction and have 
restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. The list below gives some examples of the 
types of behaviors that are common in people diagnosed with ASD. Not all people with 
ASD will have all behaviors, but most will have several of the behaviors listed below",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,2
"Social communication/interaction behaviors may include:
 ⊲Making little or inconsistent eye contact
 ⊲Having a tendency not to look at or listen to people 
 ⊲Rarely sharing enjoyment of objects or activities by pointing at or showing things  
to others
 ⊲Failing to, or being slow to, respond to someone calling their name or to other 
verbal attempts to gain attention
 ⊲Having difficulties with the back and forth of conversation
 ⊲Often talking at length about a favorite subject without noticing that others are not 
interested or without giving others a chance to respond
 ⊲Having facial expressions, movements, and gestures that do not match what is 
being said
 ⊲Having an unusual tone of voice that may sound sing-song or flat and robot-like
 ⊲Having trouble understanding another person’s point of view or being unable to 
predict or understand other people’s actions
Restrictive/repetitive behaviors may include:
 ⊲Repeating certain behaviors or having unusual behaviors, such as repeating words 
or phrases (a behavior called echolalia )",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,2
" ⊲Having a lasting intense interest in certain topics, such as numbers, details, or facts
 ⊲Having overly focused interests, such as with moving objects or with parts of objects
 ⊲Getting upset by slight changes in a routine
 ⊲Being more sensitive or less sensitive than other people to sensory input, such as 
light, noise, clothing, or temperature
People with ASD may also experience sleep problems and irritability. Although people 
with ASD experience many challenges, they may also have many strengths, including:
 ⊲Being able to learn things in detail and remember information for long periods of time
 ⊲Being strong visual and auditory learners
 ⊲Excelling in math, science, music, or art
What are the causes and risk factors for ASD?
Researchers don’t know the exact causes of ASD, but studies suggest that genes can act together with influences from the environment to affect development in ways that lead to ASD. Although scientists are still trying to understand why some people develop ASD and others don’t, some factors that increase the risk of developing ASD include:
 ⊲Having a sibling with ASD
 ⊲Having older parents
 ⊲Having certain genetic conditions (For example, people with conditions such as 
Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Rett syndrome are more likely than others to have ASD.)
 ⊲Being born with a very low birth weight
Not everyone who has these risk factors develops ASD. 
How is ASD diagnosed?
Doctors diagnose ASD by looking at a person’s behavior and development. ASD can 
usually be reliably diagnosed by the age of two. It is important for those with concerns to seek out an assessment as soon as possible so that a diagnosis can be made, and treatment can begin. 
Diagnosis in Young Children
Diagnosis in young children is often a two-stage process",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,3
"Stage 1: General Developmental Screening During Well-Child Checkups
Every child should receive well-child checkups with a pediatrician or an early childhood health 
care provider. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for developmental delays at their 9-, 18-, and 24- or 30-month well-child visits, and specifically for autism at their 18- and 24-month well-child visits. Additional screenings might be needed if a child is at high risk for ASD or developmental problems. Children at high risk include those who have a family member with ASD, have some ASD behaviors, have older parents, have certain genetic conditions, or who were born at a very low birth weight.",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,3
"Parents’ experiences and concerns are very important in the screening process for young 
children. Sometimes the doctor will ask parents questions about their child’s behaviors and combine those answers with information from ASD screening tools and with his or her observations of the child. To read more about ASD screening tools, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) website at www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-screening.html ",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,4
Children who show developmental differences during this screening process will be referred for a second stage of evaluation,19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,4
"Stage 2: Additional Evaluation
This second evaluation is with a team of doctors and other health professionals who are 
experienced in diagnosing ASD. 
This team may include:
 ⊲A developmental pediatrician—a doctor who has special training in child development
 ⊲A child psychologist and/or child psychiatrist—a doctor who has specialized training 
in brain development and behavior 
 ⊲A neuropsychologist—a doctor who focuses on evaluating, diagnosing, and treating neurological, medical, and neurodevelopmental disorders 
 ⊲A speech-language pathologist—a health professional who has special training in communication difficulties
This second evaluation may assess:
 ⊲Cognitive level or thinking skills
 ⊲Language abilities
 ⊲Age-appropriate skills needed to complete daily activities independently, such as eating, dressing, and toileting
Because ASD is a complex disorder that sometimes occurs along with other illnesses or 
learning disorders, the comprehensive evaluation may include blood tests and a hearing test. 
The outcome of this evaluation will result in a formal diagnosis and recommendations  
for treatment",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,4
"Diagnosis in Older Children and Adolescents
ASD symptoms in older children and adolescents who attend school are often first recognized 
by parents and teachers and then evaluated by the school’s special education team. The school’s team may perform an initial evaluation and then recommend these children visit their primary health care doctor or a doctor who specializes in ASD for additional testing. 
Parents may talk with these doctors about their child’s social difficulties, including problems 
with subtle communication. These subtle communication issues may include problems understanding tone of voice, facial expressions, or body language. Older children and adolescents may have trouble understanding figures of speech, humor, or sarcasm. Parents may also find that their child has trouble forming friendships with peers. ",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,4
"Diagnosis in Adults
Diagnosing ASD in adults is often more difficult than diagnosing ASD in children. In adults, 
some ASD symptoms can overlap with symptoms of other mental health disorders, such 
as anxiety disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
Adults who notice signs and symptoms of ASD should talk with a doctor and ask for a 
referral for an ASD evaluation. Although testing for ASD in adults is still being refined, 
adults can be referred to a neuropsychologist, psychologist, or psychiatrist who has 
experience with ASD. The expert will ask about:
 ⊲Social interaction and 
communication challenges
 ⊲Sensory issues  ⊲Repetitive behaviors
 ⊲Restricted interests 
Information about the adult’s developmental history will help in making an accurate 
diagnosis, so an ASD evaluation may include talking with parents or other family members",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,5
"Getting a correct diagnosis of ASD as an adult can help a person understand past challenges, 
identify his or her strengths, and obtain the right kind of help. Studies are now under way 
to determine the types of services and supports that are most helpful for improving the 
functioning and community integration of transition-age youth and adults with ASD",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,5
"What are treatments for ASD?
Treatment for ASD should begin as soon as possible after diagnosis. Early treatment for 
ASD is important because proper care can reduce individuals’ difficulties while helping 
them learn new skills and make the most of their strengths. 
The wide range of issues facing people with ASD means that there is no single best 
treatment for ASD. Working closely with a doctor or health care professional is an 
important part of finding the right treatment program. 
Medication
A doctor may use medication to treat some symptoms that are common with ASD. With 
medication, a person with ASD may have fewer problems with:
 ⊲Irritability
 ⊲Aggression
 ⊲Repetitive behavior ⊲Hyperactivity
 ⊲Attention problems
 ⊲Anxiety and depression
Read more about the latest news and information on medication warnings, patient 
medication guides, or newly approved medications at the Food and Drug Administration’s 
website at www.fda.gov ",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,5
"Behavioral, Psychological, and Educational Therapy
People with ASD may be referred to doctors who specialize in providing behavioral, 
psychological, educational, or skill-building interventions. These programs are typically 
highly structured and intensive and may involve parents, siblings, and other family members. 
These programs may help people with ASD:",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,5
" ⊲Increase or build upon strengths. 
 ⊲Learn social, communication, and language skills",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,6
"Other Resources
There are many social services programs and other resources that can help people with 
ASD. Here are some tips for finding these additional services:
 ⊲Contact your doctor, local health department, school, or autism advocacy group to 
learn about special programs or local resources",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,6
" ⊲Find an autism support group. Sharing information and experiences can help 
individuals with ASD and/or their caregivers learn about treatment options and 
ASD-related programs",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,6
" ⊲Record conversations and meetings with health care providers and teachers. This 
information helps when it’s time to make decisions about which programs might best 
meet an individual’s needs",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,6
" ⊲Keep copies of doctors’ reports and evaluations. This information may help an 
individual qualify for special programs",19-mh-8084-autismspectrumdisorder.pdf,6

What are clinical trials?
Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases 
and conditions. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works 
and is safe. Although individual participants may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, 
participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new 
scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future. 
Researchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and 
healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what 
clinical trials uncovered years ago. Be part of tomorrow’s medical breakthroughs. Talk to 
your doctor about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.
