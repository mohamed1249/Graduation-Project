                        After symptoms appear on the child, he is directed to a medical examination and the necessary
                        X-rays
                        (EEG) are performed. It turns out that the EEG is higher than normal, so the possibility of
                        hyperactivity in the child increases. Then its severity is measured using the Conners test to
                        estimate the child’s behavior. The Conners test is not applied until the child has symptoms for
                        6
                        months. The symptoms must appear in two different places and not just one place. The Conners
                        test is
                        applied from 3 to 17 years of age.</p>
